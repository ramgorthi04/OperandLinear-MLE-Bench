    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: You’re very close. Below are crisp, medal-proven defaults and decisions synthesized from top solutions and pitfalls. Apply these in order.\n\n1) Vectorization (what won)\n- Text: concat Title + Body. Upweight title (e.g., text = title + ' ' + title + ' ' + body).\n- Words: ngram_range=(1,2) (try (1,3) if RAM allows); sublinear_tf=True; smooth_idf=True; norm='l2'; min_df=3–5; max_df=0.9–0.95; max_features 200k–500k.\n- Token pattern to keep c++/c#/.net: token_pattern=r'(?u)\\b[\\w\\+#\\.]{2,}\\b'\n- Chars: analyzer='char' or 'char_wb'; ngram_range=(3,5) or (3,6); min_df=3–5; max_features 200k–500k.\n- Combine with hstack([word_tfidf, char_tfidf]). Total features ~400k–1M depending on RAM.\n- sublinear_tf=True is a near-universal win.\n\n2) Models (micro-F1)\n- Best single: OneVsRest LinearSVC (C=0.5–1.0, loss='squared_hinge', dual=True). Use decision_function for thresholds.\n- Also strong: OneVsRest LogisticRegression(solver='saga', penalty='l2', C=3–6, max_iter=200, n_jobs=-1) for calibrated probs.\n- Blend for +0.002–0.01 micro-F1: average scores from LinearSVC and Logistic (weight by OOF F1, e.g., 0.6/0.4). Optional tiny addition: ComplementNB to help rares.\n- SGDClassifier is fine for speed baselines; slightly behind tuned SVC/LR.\n\n3) Thresholding\n- Use per-class thresholds learned from OOF; global-only is suboptimal.\n- Procedure: get OOF scores, per tag sweep thresholds (grid over percentiles or 0.0–1.0) to maximize tag F1 or greedily improve global micro-F1.\n- Fallback: ensure at least 1 tag per sample; if none pass, pick top-1 or top-K (K≈mean tags/sample, typically 2–3). Cap K≤5. Tune K on OOF.\n\n4) Preprocessing\n- Lowercase; decode entities; strip HTML (bs4 or fast regex). Concatenate Title+Body.\n- Code blocks: remove or replace with [CODE]; or truncate long blocks (e.g., keep first 300–500 chars). Don’t strip all symbols—char n-grams need them.\n- Replace URLs/emails with tokens; collapse whitespace.\n- Avoid stemming/lemmatization and stopword removal; they usually hurt here.\n- Keep + # . to preserve c++, c#, .net.\n\n5) CV protocol\n- Use multilabel iterative stratification; 5 folds with fixed random_state.\n- Generate OOF for threshold tuning. No thresholds from test.\n- Vectorizer fit: for speed, fit TF-IDF once on full train and slice for folds (minor IDF leak acceptable in practice). For strictness, fit per fold (slower).\n- Optional stability: 2–3 different seeds if ensembling.\n\n6) Efficiency\n- Prefer learned TF-IDF over Hashing for final; use Hashing+SGD only for smoke tests.\n- Feature caps that fit comfortably: word 200k–500k + char 200k–500k (watch RAM/nnz). Store CSR .npz and reuse. Avoid toarray().\n- Use n_jobs=-1 in OVR and LR; cache transforms.\n\n7) Post-processing\n- Predict full training vocabulary (don’t restrict to top-N tags).\n- Rare-tag recall: per-class thresholds already help most; slight title upweighting and a light title-only model in the blend can add recall without big precision loss.\n\n8) Common mistakes to avoid\n- Global threshold only; no fallback.\n- Ignoring char n-grams or stripping punctuation that encodes tags.\n- Over-cleaning code/HTML; losing discriminative n-grams.\n- Non-stratified KFold; misleading OOF and LB drop.\n- Tokenizer that drops c++/c#/.net.\n- Training only on frequent tags; pruning the tail.\n- Memory blowups from huge dense features; not capping max_features.\n\nRecommended starting config (fast and strong)\n- Word: TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), min_df=3, max_df=0.95, max_features=400_000, sublinear_tf=True, token_pattern=r'(?u)\\b[\\w\\+#\\.]{2,}\\b')\n- Char: TfidfVectorizer(analyzer='char', ngram_range=(3,5), min_df=3, max_features=300_000, sublinear_tf=True)\n- Model: blend LinearSVC(C=0.7–1.0) and Logistic(saga, C=4.0); average scores before thresholding.\n- CV: 5-fold iterative; fit TF-IDF once; OOF-driven per-class thresholds; fallback top-1 if empty.\n\nNext actions for your notebook\n- Implement iterative strat 5-fold; compute OOF with LR first.\n- Add char n-grams and title upweighting.\n- Learn per-class thresholds from OOF; add top-1 fallback.\n- Train LinearSVC; blend with LR scores; re-tune thresholds on blended OOF.\n- Submit. Then iterate max_features/C and K using OOF.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Fix the submission pipeline, then execute a strong sparse-linear multilabel text pipeline with tuned decoding; add a light ensemble if OOF is borderline.\n\n1) Unblocker: submission format/size\n- Output exactly: Id, Tags (space-separated), no scores/extra columns, no duplicates, only train-seen tags, no index.\n- Decode logic: apply tuned global threshold; if none pass, fallback to top-K (K≈2–3). Cap max tags per row (e.g., 5).\n- Sanity-check file size locally (<100MB). If large, raise threshold or lower K.\n\n2) Text preprocessing (Stack Exchange–aware)\n- Build text = Title + \" [SEP] \" + cleaned Body. Strip HTML, replace code blocks with a CODE token, decode HTML entities, keep punctuation; lowercase.\n- Optionally upweight title (repeat title or scale its vector 2–3x).\n- Truncate very long bodies; keep URLs as URL token.\n\n3) Features (fast, strong, memory-safe)\n- Start: HashingVectorizer word 1–2 (2^20–2^22 features, sublinear_tf) + HashingVectorizer char 3–5; hstack (csr, float32).\n- Upgrade if RAM allows: TF-IDF word 1–2 (min_df=3–5, sublinear_tf, max_features 300k–800k) + TF-IDF char 3–5 (binary or tf-idf, max_features 300k–800k); hstack.\n\n4) Model (multilabel, scalable)\n- OneVsRest LogisticRegression (saga, penalty='l2', C≈2–6, max_iter≈200, n_jobs=-1).\n- Strong simple blends: add LinearSVC (decision_function) and/or ComplementNB on word features; rank- or z-score-average decision scores.\n- NB-SVM trick (log-count ratio) is a solid alternative if LR lags.\n\n5) Validation and thresholding\n- Use iterative stratified 5-fold CV. Fit vectorizers/models on train fold only; get OOF decision scores.\n- Tune a single global threshold on OOF for micro-F1; set fallback top-K (2–3). Consider per-tag thresholds only if OOF gains >0.005.\n- Target OOF micro-F1 ≥0.71 for bronze; ≥0.76 for silver.\n\n6) Inference and submission\n- Refit on full train (optionally fit vectorizers on train+test text only). Predict decision scores; apply tuned threshold + K fallback; whitelist tags; write compact CSV.\n\n7) Efficiency/safety\n- Keep everything sparse, float32; never densify. Cache matrices (.npz); parallelize OVR. Time per fold. If RAM tight, prefer hashing.\n\n8) Common pitfalls to avoid\n- Submitting probabilities or too many tags per row.\n- Default 0.5 threshold; no fallback K.\n- Leakage by fitting vectorizers on full data during CV.\n- Over/under-cleaning code/HTML; inconsistent preprocessing train/test.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Today: Fix CSV writer (two columns, threshold+K, whitelist), verify <100MB.\n- Baseline (fast): Hashing word+char → OVR LogisticRegression → 5-fold iterative CV → tune global threshold and K → OOF target ≥0.71.\n- If OOF <0.71: improve features (TF-IDF word+char, sublinear_tf, title upweight), try LinearSVC and ComplementNB; blend scores; retune threshold/K.\n- If aiming higher with minimal effort: add FastText model; average probabilities with TF-IDF linear model; retune threshold/K.\n- Submit only after passing a local size/format check and achieving ≥0.71 OOF."

It makes sense to start by implementing the preprocessing function and constructing the vectorizers following best practices. After conducting exploratory data analysis, we should request expert review. Then, I can set up the pipeline with necessary components like cleaning, text building, and iterative stratification, which might require installing the iterstrat library. Keeping it incremental sounds smart!**Setting up preprocessing functions**\n\nI need to add a cell to build text columns and save them for later use. I'll define a function to strip HTML using either Beautiful Soup or regex, but since installing Beautiful Soup takes time, I’ll start with regex for a quick solution. Next, I'll create a MultiLabelBinarizer for generating labels and decide on the vectorizers we will build later. I should also add code in cell 3 for preprocessing, caching texts, and creating the multilabel indicator while reporting shapes and class count distributions.**Implementing text preprocessing**\n\nI’m planning to define a `clean_html` function that will remove specific code blocks, eliminate all HTML tags, unescape HTML, and replace URLs with a URL token and emails with an EMAIL token. I also want to ensure everything is lowercase and collapse whitespace. I’ll build the text by combining the title and the cleaned body. For storage, I might not save to disk just yet, but I’ll create variables for training and testing texts. Given the size of the dataset, we need to be cautious, maybe using an iterator to efficiently handle memory. Truncating the body to 2000 characters seems wise to manage this!**Optimizing text cleaning**\n\nIt seems caching to disk is necessary since we'll need to access the text multiple times, but given the size of the text, it's not the best option. A custom iterator class that reads from the DataFrame could be a solution, but the DataFrame is already in memory. To work around this, I can create a function called `get_text_series(df)` that returns a pandas Series computed lazily. I think I’ll apply efficient cleaning using vectorized regex, leveraging pandas' abilities for faster operations, like using `.str.replace` to remove HTML tags and code blocks effectively.**Implementing text preprocessing steps**\n\nI’m planning on several preprocessing steps. First, I'll fill any missing values in the `Body` column with empty strings. Then, I’ll use regex to remove code blocks and strip HTML tags. For now, I might skip unescaping HTML to save time, though I could also leave it. I’ll replace URLs and emails with tokens, convert everything to lowercase, and truncate each body to 2000 characters. The title will also be modified similarly. Finally, I’ll build the label set using `MultiLabelBinarizer` and print out some stats before moving on to the next cell for vectorization.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 3,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"import re, time, pandas as pd, numpy as np, html\",\n      \"from sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer\",\n      \"t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def split_tags(s):\",\n      \"    if pd.isna(s): return []\",\n      \"    return str(s).strip().split()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Fast, vectorized StackExchange cleaning respecting symbols like + # .\",\n      \"def build_clean_text(df: pd.DataFrame, title_col='Title', body_col='Body', title_repeat=2, body_maxlen=2000):\",\n      \"    title = df[title_col].fillna('').astype(str)\",\n      \"    body = df[body_col].fillna('').astype(str)\",\n      \"    # Remove code blocks\",\n      \"    body = body.str.replace(r'<pre><code>[\\\\s\\\\S]*?</code></pre>', ' CODE ', regex=True)\",\n      \"    # Strip HTML tags\",\n      \"    body = body.str.replace(r'<[^>]+>', ' ', regex=True)\",\n      \"    # URLs and emails\",\n      \"    body = body.str.replace(r'https?://\\\\S+', ' URL ', regex=True)\",\n      \"    body = body.str.replace(r'\\\\b[\\\\w\\\\.-]+@[\\\\w\\\\.-]+\\\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\\\\b', ' EMAIL ', regex=True)\",\n      \"    # Lowercase\",\n      \"    body = body.str.lower()\",\n      \"    title = title.str.lower()\",\n      \"    # Truncate long bodies\",\n      \"    if body_maxlen is not None:\",\n      \"        body = body.str.slice(0, int(body_maxlen))\",\n      \"    # Upweight title by repetition\",\n      \"    if title_repeat and title_repeat > 1:\",\n      \"        title_rep = (title + ' ') * int(title_repeat)\",\n      \"    else:\",\n      \"        title_rep = title\",\n      \"    text = (title_rep + ' ' + body).str.replace('\\\\s+', ' ', regex=True).str.strip()\",\n      \"    return text\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('Building cleaned text for train/test...', flush=True)\",\n      \"train_text = build_clean_text(train, 'Title', 'Body', title_repeat=2, body_maxlen=2000)\",\n      \"test_text  = build_clean_text(test,  'Title', 'Body', title_repeat=2, body_maxlen=2000)\",\n      \"print(f'train_text samples: {len(train_text)}, test_text samples: {len(test_text)}')\",\n      \"print('Example cleaned text:', train_text.iloc[0][:200], '...')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Prepare multilabel targets\",\n      \"y_lists = train['Tags'].apply(split_tags)\",\n      \"mlb = MultiLabelBinarizer(sparse_output=True)\",\n      \"Y = mlb.fit_transform(y_lists)\",\n      \"print(f'Labels shape: {Y.shape} (samples, classes); nnz labels: {int(Y.nnz)}; classes: {len(mlb.classes_)}')\",\n      \"print('Top classes:', list(mlb.classes_[:10]))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print(f'Preprocessing done in {time.time()-t0:.1f}s', flush=True)\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\"\n  }\n}",

Instead, I should plan the next cell for vectorization and a smoke-run using HashingVectorizer and LogisticRegression for quick out-of-fold predictions. \n\nThe data set has a massive size of 5.4 million rows, so I really want to start with a subsample for best practices. Let's aim for about 200,000 rows and use the iterstrat package for stratification. I'll need to install it too!**Setting up vectorization**\n\nI need to prepare a cell that installs iterstrat and creates a function for generating folds. Since scikit-learn is available, I'll set up a smoke-run vectorization using HashingVectorizer to keep it quick; it doesn't require fitting. \n\nI’ll use `from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import HashingVectorizer` and optionally include a TfidfTransformer to handle term frequencies. I plan to set the features to around 1 million for both word and character frequencies. This will depend on existing data, so it’ll rely on cell 3’s output. Training on 200k rows with a high feature count might be heavy, but hashing plus tf-idf should help with that.**Defining smoke run setup**\n\nI think I’ll choose 100,000 rows for my smoke test and log the time while only using one fold to test the pipeline. I need out-of-fold results to tune the thresholds later, and for this smoke run, two small folds should work. \n\nTo manage memory, I should set the vectors to dtype float32 because scikit-learn defaults to float64. I can specify the dtype for HashingVectorizer, and I think TfidfTransformer should preserve the input's dtype as well. I’m planning to compute decision scores and micro-F1 with a threshold of 0.3.

    "llm_json": "**Implementing micro-F1 and TfidfTransformer**\n\nI'm looking at micro-F1 from sklearn.metrics and how to use float32 in hashing. I need to consider the HashingVectorizer's dtype parameter and apply TfidfTransformer for IDF. Since hashing doesn't compute IDF and we want to stack our matrices, I should fit TfidfTransformer on the concatenated matrix but first fit on the train subset to avoid leakage. I’ll also implement logging and timing and set up the random state for subset indices. For folds, I'll employ MultilabelStratifiedKFold but ensure the input is array-like and handle the size concerns efficiently.**Considering model training constraints**\n\nI'm dealing with the limitation that I can’t densify data. The MultilabelStratifiedKFold from iterstrat supports sparse matrices, so I'll use Y_sub. I plan to create two HashingVectorizers: one for words and another for characters, with specifics on features and n-grams. However, training on 100k samples with so many features while maintaining 41k classes is overwhelming. I need to consider training only on present tags or possibly using linear SVM with liblinear, but that will also face slow performance issues with one model per class.**Planning tag filtering and classifier strategy**\n\nIn practice, it seems like they trained on the full 5.4M rows, possibly using liblinear with class frequency filtering. For this smoke-run, I can limit the focus to the top N tags, such as the top 5000, to validate the pipeline. For full training, I might adopt SGDClassifier with partial_fit for multi-label support. I know it wraps nicely with OneVsRest, but training 41k classes might remain too heavy. A feasible route could be to apply a tag frequency cutoff for classes, starting with the top 20k by frequency and ignoring the less frequent tags for now.**Implementing multi-label binarizer and model training**\n\nTo create the multi-label binarizer (mlb), I already have Y for all classes. I can compute class frequencies and determine the top_k indices to slice Y accordingly while updating the class list. For decoding predictions, I’ll focus solely on the tags seen during training, which may limit recall for rare tags, but micro weighting should handle that. I’ll set top_k to 5000 and subsample to 100k rows. I’ll also prepare to implement vectorization and fit the TfidfTransformer, then train the OneVsRest SGDClassifier with appropriate parameters.**Choosing classifiers and tuning thresholds**\n\nThe OneVsRest approach can indeed handle many classes, so fitting 5000 models might be heavy, but on 100k samples, and with hashing, it could be manageable. I'm considering whether to use LinearSVC instead, but since SGDClassifier is faster, I’ll stick with that while ensuring it has partial_fit support for multi-label.

Implementing our multilabel stratification could take time, and since sklean's StratifiedKFold can't handle multilabel, I might explore using KFold instead. I should stratify based on the number of tags or just use the top tag.

Then I can execute it!**Optimizing model parameters**\n\nI'm realizing that running with 100k rows and the top 2000 features might be too heavy.

    "llm_json": "**Considering model implementation**\n\nI have smoke data with limited subsets, which is fine, but the next step is to implement strong TF-IDF vectorization and model it with LinearSVC and LogisticRegression. The dataset is huge at 5.4 million rows, so I need a realistic approach. Historically, many medalists used the entire dataset, but training on 41k classes with LinearSVC could be intensive. Given time constraints, I may need to create a simplified baseline for submission first before refining the model iteratively. Vectorization will need to be fitted on the full training text, though it might be memory-heavy.**Evaluating training options**\n\nTraining LogisticRegression with 41k classes seems infeasible time-wise. An alternative could be predicting only among top tags; since the LB micro F1 metric considers all tags, predicting top N tags might be sufficient since rare ones add little value. While some solutions limit to 50k, we can keep all 41k. Blending LinearSVC and LogisticRegression scores seems advisable, but implementing a baseline may require training LogisticRegression on a 1M rows subsample to manage time while ensuring feasibility. I might focus on the top 10k classes for this.**Planning submission strategy**\n\nI think it’s best to take a simpler path for producing the submission. I’ll train an SGDClassifier on a larger subset with the top 5,000 classes and then predict the test set to create the submission.csv. This approach might give a modest score above the median, possibly reaching a Micro-F1 of 0.6-0.7. To refine my model, I’ll add code to fit TF-IDF vectorizers on the combined train and test text, focusing on efficiency by fitting on a subset for speed. Afterwards, I should request an expert review to refine our scaling strategy within the 24-hour framework.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Baseline smoke-run completed: Hashing(word 1-2 + char 3-5) -> TfidfTransformer -> OneVsRest SGDClassifier(log_loss), 50k subsample, top 1k tags, 2-fold KFold. OOF micro-F1 ~0.452 at thr=0.2. Plan next: move to TF-IDF with max_features per your defaults and train stronger models (LinearSVC + Logistic) with per-class thresholds and blend. Given dataset scale (5.4M rows, 41.8k tags), please advise: 1) Practical feature caps and memory targets to fit TF-IDF word+char on full train (or train+test) within 440GB RAM and keep CSR manageable; safe max_features per block to avoid nnz explosion? 2) Efficient training strategy under 24h: a) Train on full data with all 41k tags using LinearSVC OVR is likely too heavy; what tag cap (e.g., top 10k/15k/20k) balances micro-F1 vs runtime? b) Should we train on all rows or sample (e.g., 1\\u20132M) without large LB loss? c) Prefer LR(saga) OVR vs LinearSVC runtime on this scale? 3) Vectorization protocol: Fit TF-IDF once on all train_text (and optionally test) then slice for folds vs per-fold fit (OOF strictness vs speed). 4) Thresholding: move from global to per-class thresholds learned on OOF; recommended fast optimization method over 41k classes (percentile sweep, isotonic-lite, or greedy micro-F1 improve)? 5) Title upweighting and body truncation: we currently repeat title x2 and trim body to 2000 chars; recommend different repeats/length caps? 6) For a medal within time, what minimal ensemble would you prioritize (LinearSVC + LR blend, maybe complement NB word-only) and how to schedule runs (e.g., start LR training first due to longer time)? 7) Any pitfalls when scaling from subset to full: solver settings (C, tol, class_weight), n_jobs usage in OVR for stability, and best logging/checkpointing to avoid sunk-cost runs. Thanks.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: You’re close. Here’s the shortest path to a medal, synthesizing all reviews and tailored to your setup/logs.\n\nFirst fix\n- Use iterative-stratification: pip install iterative-stratification; from iterstrat.ml_stratifiers import MultilabelStratifiedKFold. Do not use plain KFold for final OOF.\n\n1) Feature caps and memory targets\n- Build one TF‑IDF on train+test, cache to NPZ, dtype=float32.\n- Word TF‑IDF: ngram_range=(1,2), token_pattern=r'(?u)\\b[\\w\\+#\\.]{2,}\\b', min_df=3–5, max_df=0.95, sublinear_tf=True, max_features=400k (safe).\n- Char TF‑IDF: analyzer='char' (or 'char_wb'), ngram_range=(3,5), min_df=3–5, sublinear_tf=True, max_features=300k (safe).\n- Combined ~700k feats. Expect 100–200 GB CSR total across word+char with your body cap; fits in 440 GB. Monitor X.nnz; if high, drop to 300k+200k.\n- Preprocess: keep + # .; replace code with “CODE”, URLs “URL”, emails “EMAIL”; lowercase.\n\n2) Efficient training under 24h\n- Train on all rows and all 41.8k tags for the final run. Subsample only for quick HP checks.\n- Tag cap: avoid. If you must to meet time, temporary cap at 30k (≈0.01–0.02 micro‑F1 loss), then refit full if time remains.\n- Start with LogisticRegression OVR (saga) for calibrated scores; add LinearSVC OVR for a +0.01–0.02 blend gain.\n  - LR: LogisticRegression(solver='saga', penalty='l2', C=4.0, max_iter=200, tol=1e-3). Wrap in OneVsRestClassifier.\n  - LinearSVC: LinearSVC(C=0.7–1.0, loss='squared_hinge', dual=True, tol=1e-3). Wrap in OneVsRestClassifier. Use decision_function scores.\n- Runtime guidance: fit once on full TF‑IDF, 5-fold MSkF, save OOF/test per fold. If tight, use 3 folds for the SVC.\n\n3) Vectorization protocol\n- Fit TF‑IDF once on concatenated train_text+test_text; slice for folds. Cache with scipy.sparse.save_npz. This is standard; per‑fold fit is too slow and gains negligible rigor here.\n\n4) Thresholding at scale\n- Learn per‑class thresholds on OOF. Fast approach: for each class, sweep percentiles of its OOF scores (e.g., 5–95 by 2.5) and pick the best F1. Optional greedy refine by class frequency.\n- Prediction fallback: if a sample has zero positives, set the top‑1 tag; tune K∈{1,2,3} on OOF (usually K=1).\n- Apply learned thresholds to test scores (for blends too).\n\n5) Title upweighting and body truncation\n- Use title_repeat=3. Keep body_maxlen=1800–2000. Keep symbols for c++/c#/.net; keep “CODE” placeholder.\n\n6) Minimal ensemble and schedule\n- Minimal, medal‑safe:\n  - Model A: OVR Logistic(saga) on full word+char TF‑IDF, all 41.8k.\n  - Model B: OVR LinearSVC on same features, all 41.8k.\n  - Blend scores: e.g., 0.6 SVC + 0.4 LR; learn thresholds on blended OOF; apply to blended test.\n- 24h schedule:\n  - H0–3: Fit/cached TF‑IDF on train+test; build MSkF splits.\n  - H3–12: Train LR 5-fold → OOF+test scores saved per fold; submit a first LR-only run with per‑class thresholds.\n  - H12–20: Train LinearSVC 5-fold → OOF+test; blend with LR; re‑opt thresholds; final inference.\n  - Buffer: if behind, do 3 folds for SVC or cap tags at 30k for SVC only (keep LR full‑tags).\n\n7) Scaling pitfalls and hygiene\n- Don’t cap tags to 1k/5k for final; rares matter for micro‑F1.\n- Avoid Hashing for final; TF‑IDF vocab wins.\n- Parallelism: OneVsRestClassifier(n_jobs=cores). Set estimator n_jobs=1 (except saga can use n_jobs=-1), and cap threads via OMP_NUM_THREADS to avoid oversubscription.\n- class_weight=None (balanced usually hurts precision). Fix random_state. Watch convergence; increase max_iter if needed.\n- Checkpoint everything: vectorizers, MLBin, TF‑IDF matrices, per‑fold models, OOF/test score arrays, thresholds. Log times per fold. Never densify.\n\nImmediate actions in your notebook\n- Replace pip install iterstrat with pip install iterative-stratification and switch to MultilabelStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42).\n- Update cleaning to title_repeat=3, body_maxlen≈1800–2000.\n- Build and cache word+char TF‑IDF as above; then kick off LR 5-fold OVR on all 41.8k tags.\n- Implement per‑class thresholding + top‑1 fallback on OOF; use it for test; then add LinearSVC and blend.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Fix submission, scale to all labels, and run a tuned linear OvR pipeline with strong TF‑IDF features, proper CV, and thresholding.\n\nPrioritized actions (do these now)\n- Submission fix\n  - Output exactly two columns: Id, Tags; Tags = space-separated predicted labels; no probabilities or extra columns.\n  - Ensure each row has 0–5 tags; sort by score; verify file size locally (<10MB) before upload.\n- Use all labels\n  - Drop “top-1000” restriction. Train/predict across all ~41k tags; never predict unseen tags.\n- Proper CV\n  - Install iterative-stratification: pip install iterative-stratification; use MultilabelStratifiedKFold (3–5 folds, fixed seed).\n\nModel/feature pipeline (baseline that can hit bronze)\n- Text prep\n  - Keep programming symbols (+ # . _); lowercase; strip HTML; replace code blocks with placeholder; replace URLs/emails; repeat title 2–3x; truncate body to ~2–5k chars.\n- Vectorization\n  - TF-IDF word n-grams (1–2 or 1–3), token_pattern allowing +#._, min_df=3–5, max_features ~1–2M, sublinear_tf=True, norm='l2'.\n  - TF-IDF char n-grams (3–5 or 3–6), max_features 0.5–1M.\n  - hstack(word, char) sparse matrices; build once and cache (.npz).\n- Model\n  - OneVsRest(LogisticRegression) with solver='saga', penalty='l2' (or elasticnet l1_ratio 0.1–0.3), C=2–6, max_iter=50–100, n_jobs=-1.\n  - If memory/time tight: SGDClassifier(loss='log_loss') with more epochs (e.g., max_iter=20+) and/or partial_fit over chunks across all classes.\n- Decoding/thresholding\n  - Tune global threshold on OOF micro-F1; add per-sample top-K fallback (K=2–3) if none exceed threshold.\n  - Optional boost: per-class thresholds (or by frequency buckets) and add logit(prior) bias for rare tags.\n\nScaling/efficiency essentials\n- Cache vectorized train/test (save_npz); slice folds without refitting vectorizers.\n- Parallelize OvR (n_jobs=-1); consider HashingVectorizer only if TF-IDF memory is a blocker (then add TfidfTransformer).\n- If full 5.4M rows is infeasible, start with a 0.5–1M stratified subset to tune params/thresholds, then scale up.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Don’t output probabilities or per-label columns in submission.\n- Don’t filter rare tags in final training.\n- Don’t use plain KFold; use multilabel stratification.\n- Don’t fix threshold at 0.5; always tune on OOF.\n- Ensure train/test preprocessing is identical; only predict labels in mlb.classes_.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Fix submission writer; validate on a tiny mock file.\n- Install iterative-stratification; switch to MultilabelStratifiedKFold.\n- Build TF-IDF word+char features; cache matrices.\n- Train OvR LogisticRegression (saga, C≈4, max_iter≥50) on all labels; if constrained, use SGD with more iters/epochs and partial_fit.\n- Tune global threshold on OOF; add top-K fallback.\n- Generate final predictions (sorted, space-separated), verify size, submit."

The IDE indicates it hasn't been executed yet, but earlier logs show it's heavy and likely still running. We should probably wait a bit longer. However, I can prepare the next cells. I’ll plan to train the LogisticRegression model using 5-fold MSkF with cached TF-IDF matrices. \n\nI'll add a new cell to implement training, including all the best practices like logging and setting thread limits, ensuring efficiency along the way.**Structuring model training**\n\nSince cell 6 hasn't produced the X matrices yet, I need to code the loading process for when they exist. I plan to implement thresholds per class, which involves sweeping percentiles. Calculating thresholds for 41k classes will be computationally heavy, so I might compute a global threshold first before refining it later. \n\nHowever, the expert recommends per-class thresholds for better gains, so I'll include a function for that. I’ll also set up MSkF splits and begin training the LogisticRegression model while logging progress. Given the large dataset, I’ll cap environmental threads too.**Planning training folds**\n\nI’m considering starting with 3 folds for now, even though the expert recommends 5. I could create a variable to easily adjust the number of folds later. Right now, though, I should prioritize completing the TF-IDF build, so maybe I should wait for cell 6 to finish before adding any heavy code. \n\nBut it’s also okay to add code while execution is ongoing. I’ll prepare cell 7 as a training scaffold: loading cached matrices, using MultilabelStratifiedKFold, and setting up the OneVsRestClassifier with logical settings for LogisticRegression that supports multi-threading.**Configuring parallel processing**\n\nI’m checking the memory settings and planning to set `n_jobs=8` in the estimator. I’ll wrap the OneVsRestClassifier with `n_jobs=-1` for parallel processing across classes. Combining both can lead to oversubscription, so I should set the estimator’s `n_jobs=1` while allowing OVR to use the maximum cores available.\n\nTo keep things manageable, I’ll set `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` and let OVR use `n_jobs=12` for parallelization. I’ll import needed libraries and save results for each fold, making sure to compute for the test in manageable batches.**Planning predictions and thresholds**\n\nI need to compute decision scores and probabilities on `X_te`, saving the fold predictions, but I should be cautious about memory since the test shape is quite large—603k x 700k—and predicting across 41k labels could be heavy. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I might focus initially on producing Out-Of-Fold (OOF) predictions first instead of testing, but we will need a submission later. I'll use `predict_proba` for probabilities and later apply `decision_function` for LinearSVC.\n\nOnce training is complete, I plan to compute OOF micro-F1 using a global threshold of 0.2, implementing per-class threshold tuning later. I’ll scaffold a cell to control `n_splits` and a class cap variable, allowing flexibility when needed.

    "llm_json": "**Optimizing F1 scores**\n\nI'm realizing that optimizing per-class F1 might not maximize micro-F1, although experts recommend it. I’ll implement a quick version with per-class F1, plus a fallback K=1 if none are chosen. \n\nNext, I need to load averaged test predictions from cached files and decode them with thresholds, ensuring to clip them to classes. To save the results in submission.csv, I’ll have to average across various folds while being cautious of memory concerns due to the large data size. It seems like I can't store everything as a single array.**Finding an efficient approach**\n\nI really need to rethink how to predict on the test data more efficiently. Instead of saving the whole matrix, I’m considering predicting in chunks and writing tags incrementally. However, thresholds need out-of-fold data to compute. \n\nCurrent code saves predictions for the whole test set, which isn't memory efficient and will blow up RAM. A better idea is to predict per chunk and accumulate scores in a memmap on disk to manage memory better. Still, even a memmap of 100GB is quite large, but I think it could work within the 1.4TB disk space!**Adjusting logistic regression predictions**\n\nFor logistic regression with OneVsRest in scikit-learn, it looks like predicting in class batches isn't straightforward using predict_proba. However, I can use the estimators_ list to predict for each class on chunks of Xt and gradually fill out the memmap. \n\nI’ll need to adjust my training code later by saving the estimators_ after fitting. It’d be better to loop through classes in batches when predicting the test data, getting probabilities for each class separately, which is more efficient. Editing cell 7 now seems like a good idea too.**Implementing chunked predictions**\n\nWith cell 6 running, it’s time to edit cell 7 to enable chunked test predictions and write the memmap file 'cache/test_lr_avg.dat' with the desired shape and data type. I can determine n_test and n_classes from Xt and Y_all shapes, so I’ll replace the current method of saving npy files per fold. \n\nI'll need to create a memmap file with 'w+' for the first fold and 'r+' for subsequent ones. Class batching is also important, and while predicting probabilities per class might be slow, OneVsRestClassifier could help with parallelization, even if it has high memory demands.**Modifying for class predictions**\n\nI can process the predictions class by class, using batches of around 256 classes and leveraging list comprehension to compute each estimator on Xt while stacking results. It's still a heavy operation, and time constraints mean that starting with logistic regression in just five folds might be too time-consuming, but I’ll go ahead anyway.\n\nI also plan to adjust cell 8 to implement thresholds per class by reading out-of-fold data and calculating thresholds with vectorized percentiles to avoid loops. I'll choose to modify cell 7 for that.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 7,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"import os, time, numpy as np, scipy.sparse as sp\",\n      \"from scipy.sparse import load_npz\",\n      \"from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier\",\n      \"from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\",\n      \"from iterstrat.ml_stratifiers import MultilabelStratifiedKFold\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Training config\",\n      \"n_splits = 5  # set to 3 if runtime becomes tight\",\n      \"C_lr = 4.0\",\n      \"max_iter_lr = 200\",\n      \"random_state = 42\",\n      \"ovr_jobs = max(1, os.cpu_count()//3)  # parallelize across classes conservatively\",\n      \"test_batch_classes = 256  # number of classes per batch during test prediction to limit RAM\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Thread caps to avoid oversubscription\",\n      \"os.environ.setdefault('OMP_NUM_THREADS', '8')\",\n      \"os.environ.setdefault('MKL_NUM_THREADS', '8')\",\n      \"os.environ.setdefault('OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS', '8')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('Loading cached TF-IDF matrices ...', flush=True)\",\n      \"X_train_path = 'cache/X_train_tfidf.npz'\",\n      \"X_test_path  = 'cache/X_test_tfidf.npz'\",\n      \"assert os.path.exists(X_train_path) and os.path.exists(X_test_path), 'Cached TF-IDF not found yet.'\",\n      \"X = load_npz(X_train_path).tocsr()\",\n      \"Xt = load_npz(X_test_path).tocsr()\",\n      \"print(f'Loaded X: {X.shape}, nnz={X.nnz:,} | Xt: {Xt.shape}, nnz={Xt.nnz:,}', flush=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Use all labels\",\n      \"Y_all = Y  # from earlier cell (sparse CSR)\",\n      \"n_samples, n_classes = Y_all.shape\",\n      \"n_test = Xt.shape[0]\",\n      \"print(f'Labels: {n_classes} classes over {n_samples} samples;

It’s a bug, and I need to store out-of-fold (OOF) scores in a way that's more efficient, like using sparse storage or saving by fold. I’m thinking of modifying cell 7 to use memmap for 'cache/oof_lr.dat' with shape (n_samples, n_classes) as float32. Since I have 1.4 TiB of disk space, I can memmap the 900 GB without a problem.**Modifying memory usage**\n\nI’m considering memory mapping, which doesn’t load everything into RAM, but writing can be heavy on resources. So, I’ll modify cell 7 to create a memmap for 'cache/oof_lr.dat', where I’ll write P_va rows at `va_idx`. After processing all folds, I can compute thresholds by reading along specific axes from the memmap. I’ll also add cell 8 later to compute thresholds using sparse Y for true positives and false positives. The main task right now is to implement the modifications in cell 7 and ensure class batching uses Xt for each class.**Implementing changes in cell 7**\n\nI’m ready to implement changes in cell 7. First, I’ll create a memmap at 'cache/oof_lr.dat' with shape (n_samples, n_classes) as float32 in write mode, initialized to zeros. During the fold loop, I’ll write `oof_mem[va_idx, :] = P_va`.

    "llm_json": "**Computing thresholds**\n\nI’m thinking about finding the best threshold over a grid by using running counts based on the distribution of scores with labels. For each threshold t, I need to calculate true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). It’s doable by accumulating counts over folds without storing all the scores. I can binarize the predicted scores for each fold and sum them against the labels. The size of my data per fold could be about 1.086 million by 41,781 classes.**Evaluating memory constraints**\n\nI'm calculating that the total training size is 5.43 million rows, which per fold translates to about 1.086 million rows and 41,781 classes, totaling around 45 billion entries. Keeping P_va in memory as float32 for each fold isn’t feasible. I can't save these enormous P_va arrays — approximately 181 GB each — using the np.save method due to high disk usage. Writing a full out-of-fold memory map would be 908 GB, which is possible on a 1.4 TB disk but could take a very long time, indicating potential issues with the one-vs-rest logistic regression approach.**Reevaluating classifier strategy**\n\nI'm noticing that historically, top solutions trained classifiers per tag, likely using more efficient implementations and possibly smaller datasets. There's a concern with Kaggle's competition having 6 million training rows. Training one-vs-rest (OvR) with 41,000 models on 5.4 million rows and high-dimensional TFIDF could be unmanageable in terms of CPU time and disk space. I'm thinking about alternative approaches, like using LinearSVC or linear models with liblinear, and training on a smaller subset of 1 million rows to save time and memory while doing three folds. However, I still need probabilities for predictions, which could complicate things.**Considering feature building strategies**\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I should finish the feature building and find a simpler path forward. One idea is to use probabilistic label ranking or treat the problem as tag suggestion using kNN based on TF-IDF. For each question, we could find nearest neighbors in the training data to gather tags. However, with 5.4 million training instances, kNN could become too heavy. Maybe we could consider using approximate nearest neighbors with FAISS on GPU, but there are installation issues. Ultimately, I might need to train on a smaller subset and limit classes to the top 30,000 to aim for a competitive result.**Planning the next steps**\n\nI think I should let the TF-IDF process finish before implementing logistic regression (LR) on 1 million rows with 3 folds. After that, I can produce a submission. For now, it seems best to take a break and wait for the transformation and caching to complete. I’ll take a 15-minute pause to recharge and then reevaluate where things stand. This way, I can ensure everything is in order when I get back.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"sleep\",\n  \"sleep_payload\": {\n    \"sleep_duration_minutes\": 15.0\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Waiting for cell 6 to finish TF-IDF char fit and train/test transforms plus caching.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating classification strategy**\n\nExperts might suggest using LinearSVC's decision_function and calibrating, or opting for SGDClassifier with log and class weights. Historical data shows many winners utilized about 1.8M rows from a dataset of 5.4M. Training on 30k classes with OvR LR could be heavy. We need expert input to find a feasible approach—perhaps training on all rows but restricting to the top 10k classes. Using partial_fit with SGDClassifier could speed things up. I'll request expert review before moving forward.**Requesting expert review**\n\nI'll use the request_expert_review with the filepath main.ipynb to explain the training plan and highlight concerns about runtime. I’ll ask for adjustments to parameters such as n_splits, class caps, row subsampling, and model choice (LinearSVC vs. LR(SAGA) vs. SGDClassifier). It’s also important to discuss test prediction batching. Overall, I want to ensure we’re approaching this efficiently, so getting expert feedback seems like the right step forward. Let's go ahead with that!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Major checkpoint before heavy training. Plan: Execute Cell 7 to train OneVsRest(LogisticRegression, saga) on TF-IDF(word+char) with memmaps. Current config: n_splits=3, top_classes=30k, subsample_rows=1M, C=4.0, max_iter=200, ovr_jobs ~12, test batch by 256 classes. Concern: 1M x 700k sparse with 30k OvR LR models seems intractable in 24h; likely to run for many hours or fail due to time/CPU. Ask for medal-proven guidance: 1) Should we switch to OneVsRest(LinearSVC) (decision_function) for speed and blend later with a smaller LR/SGD model? 2) Recommended feasible caps for classes and rows to hit a medal quickly (e.g., 10k\\u201315k classes, all rows vs 1\\u20132M rows)? 3) Whether to train on all rows but fewer classes vs more classes with fewer rows (which wins for micro-F1 here)? 4) Suggested regularization and solver for LR if we keep it (C, l1_ratio?) and any class weighting? 5) Better parallelism strategy: n_jobs for OVR vs inside LR, threads limits, and safe batching for test preds. 6) Thresholding plan: per-class thresholds via OOF vs global + top-K fallback; practical grid size. 7) Any gotchas with fitting vectorizers on train+test we should adjust?

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the fastest safe path to a medal, synthesizing all reviews and your notebook state.\n\nDo this now (baseline that finishes in 6–8h and ≥0.71 micro-F1 OOF):\n- Switch to OneVsRest(LinearSVC) and use decision_function scores. It’s 2–4x faster than LR(saga) here with equal/better micro-F1.\n- Use all rows, cap classes at 20k (15k if you need extra safety). For micro-F1, more rows > more classes.\n- Fix your split bug: pass a small dense Y to MultilabelStratifiedKFold, not the sparse Y_use. Use Y_split = Y_use[:, top 200 by freq].toarray().astype(int).\n- Avoid nested threading: set estimator single-threaded and parallelize at OVR.\n  - env: OMP_NUM_THREADS=1, MKL_NUM_THREADS=1, OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1\n  - OneVsRestClassifier(n_jobs=12–16); LinearSVC has no n_jobs param (single-thread by default).\n- Test batching: keep 256 classes per batch (128 if RAM spikes).\n\nConcrete training config (replace current Cell 7 loop):\n- Data caps:\n  - keep_cls = top 20_000 by frequency (or 15_000 if timing is tight)\n  - rows: use all 5.43M (no subsample)\n- CV and splits:\n  - n_splits=3 with MultilabelStratifiedKFold(shuffle=True, random_state=42)\n  - Y_split = Y_use[:, top 200 by freq].astype(bool).toarray().astype(int)\n- Model:\n  - clf = OneVsRestClassifier(LinearSVC(C=0.7–1.0, loss='squared_hinge', dual=True, tol=1e-3, max_iter=1000, random_state=42), n_jobs=12–16)\n- Predictions:\n  - Use decision_function for OOF and test. Store to float32 memmaps, same shapes you already use.\n  - Class-batch the test prediction loop; for each class, est.decision_function(Xt).\n\nThresholding (essential):\n- Optimize per-class thresholds on OOF scores:\n  - For each class c, compute percentiles of positive-class OOF scores; try p in [60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92.5, 95, 97.5, 99]; pick thr maximizing per-class F1, or compute a small fixed grid on raw margins (e.g., np.linspace(-1, 1, 21)). This runs in minutes with joblib.\n  - Fallback: if a row has zero positives, set top-K by score (K=1 or 2; tune on OOF micro-F1).\n- Apply thresholds to test scores to decode predictions.\n\nExpected:\n- Runtime: ~4–6h with 20k classes; 15k finishes faster. OOF micro-F1 typically 0.72–0.74 with per-class thresholds + top-1 fallback.\n\nRows vs classes guidance:\n- For micro-F1: all rows + 15–20k classes beats 1–2M rows + 30k classes by ~0.01–0.02. Start with all rows + 20k classes.\n\nIf you still want LR (for blend, not baseline):\n- Use a smaller LR model to complement SVC:\n  - Rows: 1.0–1.5M; Classes: 12–20k\n  - LogisticRegression(solver='saga', penalty='l2', C=4.0, max_iter=100–200, tol=1e-3, n_jobs=1), class_weight=None\n  - Optionally elasticnet: penalty='elasticnet', l1_ratio=0.1–0.15 (slower; minor gain).\n- Blend scores on OOF (scale first):\n  - Per class, z-score or min-max the SVC margins and LR probs.\n  - S_blend = 0.6*SVC + 0.4*LR; re-optimize per-class thresholds on blended OOF; apply to blended test.\n  - Typical uplift +0.01–0.03 micro-F1 (silver path).\n\nParallelism and memory:\n- Keep OVR n_jobs at ~half to 2/3 of cores (12–16). Do not set threads >1 in BLAS/estimator to avoid oversubscription.\n- Keep class-batch 128–256; flush memmaps periodically.\n\nVectorizer:\n- Your TF-IDF fit on train+test is correct; keep sublinear_tf, token pattern preserving c++/c#/.net, and float32. No per-fold refits.\n\nMinimal code edits checklist in Cell 7:\n- Remove n_rows_subsample; use X = X_full.\n- Set top_classes = 20000 (or 15000).\n- Build Y_split dense (top 200 labels) and pass that to mskf.split(..., Y_split).\n- Replace LR with LinearSVC in OneVsRest; use decision_function for OOF/test; keep memmaps.\n- Thread caps to 1; OneVsRest n_jobs=12–16; estimator single-thread.\n- Keep your test class-batching; switch predict_proba to decision_function.\n\nNext model (after baseline submission):\n- Train the smaller LR model above and blend; or train a second LinearSVC with slightly different C (e.g., 1.0 vs 0.7) or a title-only TF-IDF LinearSVC, then blend. This is a fast +0.005–0.015.\n\nThis plan fits under 6–8 hours for the baseline and gets ≥0.71 micro-F1 reliably, with a clear blend path to medal.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: execute a lean, memory-safe linear baseline with per-class thresholds and a clean submission; then add a small blend if time remains.\n\nPriorities (in order)\n- Fix submission: output exactly two columns (Id, Tags). Tags are space-separated tag names, deduped. Enforce top-K fallback (K=3) and cap max tags per sample (≤6) to keep file <100MB.\n- Avoid giant arrays: never store full [n_test × n_classes] or giant OOF matrices. Predict/threshold in batches and stream-write submission.\n- Thresholding: learn per-class thresholds from validation folds; use top-K fallback when none pass.\n\nModel/feature essentials\n- Keep current TF-IDF setup: train+test fit, word 1–2 + char 3–5, sublinear_tf=True, custom token_pattern to preserve c++/c#, title_repeat=3, trimmed body.\n- Start with OneVsRest LinearSVC (fast, strong). Add OneVsRest LogisticRegression (saga, C≈3–6, max_iter≈30–60) and blend if time.\n- Blend scores: 0.6*zscore(SVC decision_function) + 0.4*LR probabilities (or minmax per class).\n\nScale plan (performance vs time)\n- Classes: start 20k–30k head classes. Increase toward 35k+ only if time permits; full 42k is ideal but risky under constraints.\n- Data: prefer all rows for SVC if feasible; for LR use 1–2M rows first (then scale up).\n- Folds: 3 folds is fine; go 5 only if time remains.\n\nCV + thresholds without huge OOF\n- Use MultilabelStratifiedKFold; build dense matrix of top ~200 labels only to generate splits (no refitting vectorizers).\n- For each fold:\n  - Train model(s) on train fold.\n  - Score only validation samples.\n  - Per class c, choose threshold t_c that maximizes F1 on that fold’s validation (or use a percentile of positive scores if speed-bound).\n- Aggregate t_c across folds (median/mean). Keep a global top-K fallback (K=3).\n\nTest-time decoding (streamed)\n- Process test in sample batches (e.g., 50k):\n  - Get SVC decision_function (and LR proba if blending), blend, apply per-class thresholds.\n  - If no tags pass, select top-K by score; cap at max 6 tags.\n  - Map indices→tag names, write lines to submission.csv incrementally.\n\nRuntime/memory knobs\n- OneVsRest n_jobs≈4–8; cap OMP/MKL/OPENBLAS threads to 4–8.\n- LinearSVC: loss='squared_hinge', C∈[0.5,1.5], tol=1e-3, max_iter≈2000, dual=True.\n- LogisticRegression: solver='saga', penalty='l2', C∈[3–8], max_iter 30–60, tol 1e-3.\n- Batch predictions and avoid any full dense allocations; no memmaps for full test scores.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Global-only thresholding (kills F1). Always per-class + top-K fallback.\n- Predicting unknown/ultra-rare tags blindly; stick to kept classes.\n- Duplicate tags, extra columns, or probabilities in submission.\n- Refitting vectorizers per fold (leakage); reuse the cached features.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Train: OvR LinearSVC on TF-IDF (20k–30k classes, 3 folds). Optionally add LR(saga) and blend.\n- Thresholds: compute per-class t_c per fold on validation; aggregate; use top-K=3 fallback and max 6 tags/sample.\n- Inference: batch scores, blend, apply thresholds, stream-write Id,Tags CSV.\n- If score is close to bronze, increment classes (e.g., 30k→35k) or add LR blend; if time-constrained, prioritize better thresholds over more classes."

    "llm_json": "**Considering training and optimization**\n\nI’m thinking about whether we should request an expert while the training is running. It makes sense to prepare the next cell code for threshold tuning and submission writing. I could add a new cell for threshold optimization using OOF memmap and also stream submission generation over the test memmap.\n\nWe’re already writing a full test_avg memmap, which amounts to roughly 48 GB. Luckily, we have enough disk space at 1.4 TiB, so it looks manageable. Writing in batches should help too!**Implementing batch processing for submissions**\n\nThe coach's feedback suggests we should stream rather than store the full test. Since we've already started, I think we should leave it as is. I want to add a cell to compute per-class thresholds from OOF memmap using a grid, then apply those thresholds to produce submission streaming in batches.\n\nWith the test_avg memmap, I can read per-row chunks. I also need to ensure we keep the mapping of kept_class_indices to original tag names and load them from the saved file. I'll create a new cell to load memmaps, tune thresholds, and decode predictions into submission.csv, streaming row-wise in 50k batches. Let’s implement this now!**Calculating micro-F1 for OOF**\n\nI need to compute the micro-F1 OOF to keep monitoring. We've got Y_use, but I can't do this in a new cell without reconstructing the same keep_cls. I’ll load kept_class_indices.npy and then calculate the OOF F1 by binarizing with thresholds to score micro.\n\nI’ll implement per-class thresholds by searching positive OOF margins, and if no positives exist, I'll fallback to a smaller grid. Additionally, I want a top-K fallback of K=3, with a cap of 6.\n\nI should load Y_all and keep_cls from cache. While Y is defined in earlier cells and still exists, it might be safer to reload it. Recomputing Y would be costly!**Using Y and implementing thresholds**\n\nI plan to rely on Y and train_text, both of which are still in memory. I’ll implement the code using Y_use = Y[:, keep_cls], but it looks like kept_class_indices.npy won’t exist until training is complete. I could write the code with a guard to ensure it runs afterward.\n\nNext, I’ll load the OOF memmap and test memmap.\n\nFor computing thresholds, I want to process each class. I’ll use Y_use[:, c].toarray().ravel() for y_true, but that might be heavy since it involves 20k classes. Instead, I could compute positive indices using Y_use.tocsc() for efficient access. Converting Y_use to CSC could be time-consuming and memory-intensive, though!**Calculating class thresholds efficiently**\n\nI’m considering the challenges of working with the large matrix (5.4M x 20k) while trying to compute per-class thresholds. Using the OOF memmap would allow for efficient threshold computation, but I need to determine the positive indices per class. Instead of the complete conversion to CSC, I am thinking about leveraging CSR for speed, as transforming the entire matrix could be too time-consuming.\n\nFor thresholds, I'll focus on the non-zero positive scores, using percentiles while avoiding the full F1 computation due to its heaviness. Although experts expected certain performance metrics, I can probably stick with the percentile approach for efficiency, targeting thresholds around p=90 or 92.5. Then post-training, I might recompute folds for additional F1 assessments!**Computing per-class thresholds efficiently**\n\nI can compute per-class thresholds based only on the positive samples in the validation fold. This will involve sorting the threshold grid and counting positives and negatives. While this requires scanning predictions per threshold across 1.8M rows and 20k classes, I can streamline it by focusing solely on column scores for each class within the validation indices. \n\nTo speed this up, I'll rely on a percentile heuristic calculated from positive scores across the OOF matrix. I’ll load the necessary memmaps, retrieve positive indices, and compute the 90th percentile for thresholds. After applying these thresholds to generate predictions, I’ll use a fallback mechanism and process rows in batches for efficient decoding. I'll bypass the micro-F1 report for simplicity.

At first, I thought it would be a whopping 112 TB, but a little math check shows it’s actually 112 GB, which seems way more manageable. That's still a lot, especially with overhead considered. I’m also noting that with liblinear's float64 usage, memory might be okay. Plus, I have 440 GB RAM to work with, so we might be in the clear for training models, but multiple classes can complicate things.**Reviewing matrix loading issues**\n\nI’m noticing that the loading process for the cached matrices is taking longer than expected—it's been over 93 seconds. Given the size of the matrices at 5.4M x 700k, loading them could take a while, even though they’re compressed. I should definitely ask for an expert review. I’m uncertain about the dual parameter settings too—dual should be False since n_samples is greater than n_features, but the expert configured it as True. I want to confirm this before proceeding!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Training Cell 7 (OvR LinearSVC) is running; loading the huge TF-IDF CSR may take minutes. Quick checkpoint on critical hyperparams before we commit hours: 1) LinearSVC dual flag: With n_samples ~5.4M and n_features ~700k, should we set dual=False per liblinear guidance (n_samples > n_features), or is dual=True empirically faster/stable here for TF-IDF? 2) C value/tol/max_iter: Currently C=0.9, tol=1e-3, max_iter=1000. Any tweak to C (0.7 vs 1.0) or tol (2e-3) to reduce runtime without losing micro-F1? 3) n_jobs=16 for OvR: With 440GB RAM, is 16 safe, or should we cap at 12 to avoid model coef_ memory spikes? 4) Class cap: using 20k. If fitting time or RAM spikes, should we preemptively drop to 15k? What micro-F1 hit should we expect? 5) Scoring loop: we iterate per-class decision_function to avoid huge dense coefficient stacking. Confirm this is the right approach (given coef_ memory ~5.6MB/class ~112GB for 20k classes). 6) Any early-stop criteria per fold we should add (e.g., monitor convergence warnings or elapsed time cutoff)?

Please advise if we should interrupt to adjust dual/n_jobs before fit proceeds past loading.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Go/no-go and minimal edits to hit medal:\n\nInterrupt now and change these before fit\n- LinearSVC: dual=False, tol=2e-3, C=0.7–0.9 (keep 0.9 if you prefer), max_iter=500–1000 (start 500; raise only if many classes hit cap).\n- OvR parallelism: n_jobs=12 (safer headroom on 440 GB; same throughput class-wise).\n- Add verbose=1 to LinearSVC to monitor convergence.\n\nRationale\n- With 5.4M samples >> 700k features, liblinear’s primal (dual=False) is typically faster/more stable for sparse TF‑IDF here. Looser tol and slightly lower C trim iterations with negligible micro‑F1 loss (≤0.002).\n- n_jobs=12 avoids rare coef_/BLAS spikes while keeping strong parallelism. Drop to 8 if RAM > ~350 GB mid‑fit.\n\nKeep as is\n- Class cap 20k: stick with it. Only drop to 15k if runtime/RAM forces it; expect ~0.005–0.015 micro‑F1 drop.\n- Per-class decision_function batching (256): correct and memory‑safe. You can reduce to 128 if RAM peaks.\n- Thread caps (OMP/MKL/OPENBLAS=1): good.\n\nEarly-stop/monitoring\n- Wall‑clock guard: if a fold > ~3h, pause and reduce n_jobs or class cap.\n- If >10% classes raise ConvergenceWarning, either accept as “good enough” or bump max_iter to 700–1000 rather than tightening tol.\n\nThresholding (Cell 8)\n- Your high‑percentile-on-positives heuristic is fine for a baseline.\n- For a small, consistent bump (+0.01–0.02 micro‑F1 OOF), do a tiny per‑class grid on raw margins (e.g., 9-point percentile grid 85–97.5% or linspace around the positive median–99th) and pick per‑class F1 best. Keep top‑K fallback (K=1–3) and cap max tags per sample (≈6).\n\nIf Cell 7 already started fitting\n- Let it run (still viable). Apply the above for the next run/folds.\n\nOptional quick uplift after this run (time permitting)\n- Train a compact OvR LogisticRegression (saga) and blend with SVC scores (e.g., 0.6 SVC + 0.4 LR; z‑score per class before blend), then re‑tune thresholds. Typical +0.01–0.02.\n\nSummary of edits to your Cell 7 classifier\n- LinearSVC(C=0.7–0.9, loss='squared_hinge', dual=False, tol=2e-3, max_iter=500–1000, random_state=42, verbose=1)\n- OneVsRestClassifier(..., n_jobs=12)\n\nThis configuration balances speed, stability, and score for your scale and should comfortably finish with medal‑level micro‑F1.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: fix file/OOF issues, pivot to LR+LinearSVC blend, scale smartly (rows/classes), and use per-class positive thresholds with top-K fallback.\n\n1) Immediate critical fixes\n- Submission size/format:\n  - Emit exactly: Id, Tags (space-separated). No probabilities/extra cols. Deduplicate, sort by score, cap to max_tags=6. Zip the CSV if near 100MB.\n  - Sanity checks: avg tags ≈ 2.8–3.2; no empty Tags; only kept classes.\n- Kill gigantic OOF/test arrays:\n  - Do NOT allocate full OOF matrices. Collect only positive OOF margins per class (and a tiny negative sample if desired). Store as per-class lists; compute thresholds from these.\n- LinearSVC settings:\n  - Use decision_function, not probabilities. Set dual=False when n_samples > n_features; increase max_iter (≈2000). Your code uses dual=True; change it.\n\n2) Scalable training plan (balance rows vs classes)\n- Data scale:\n  - Target 1.0–1.5M rows initially; push to 3M+ if wall-clock allows. Full 5.4M with 20k classes + CV won’t finish.\n  - Keep top 12k–15k classes first; later try 15k–20k. Prefer classes with ≥10–20 train samples or reasonable CV F1.\n- Features (yours are good):\n  - Keep word 1–2g + char 3–5g TF-IDF; sublinear_tf=True; token pattern preserving +/#/., title upweight 3–5x, body truncation ~1200–1800 chars. If tight on RAM/IO: word 300k + char 200k.\n- Models:\n  - Train both and blend:\n    - OneVsRest(LogisticRegression): solver='saga', penalty='l2', C≈4–12, max_iter 20–40, tol 1e-3, n_jobs=cores.\n    - OneVsRest(LinearSVC): C≈0.5–2.0, dual=False, max_iter≈2000.\n  - Blend standardized margins (per-class z-score or rank-average). Start 0.5 LR + 0.5 SVC; try 0.6 SVC + 0.4 LR.\n\n3) Validation and thresholds (without huge OOF)\n- Splits: 90/10 holdout or 3-fold MultilabelStratifiedKFold using a dense subset of top ≈200 labels only for index generation.\n- OOF collection:\n  - For each fold and class, append decision_function for validation positives. This stays small and is enough for thresholding.\n- Thresholding:\n  - Per-class thresholds = high percentile on positive OOF margins (e.g., 92.5–97.5%; use median of several high percentiles). Optionally tune one global offset to hit avg tags ≈3.\n  - Decoding fallback: if no tag passes threshold, assign top-K by score (K=3). Cap per-row tags (6–8).\n\n4) Inference and submission\n- Batch predictions over classes and rows; store scores as float16/float32 in memmaps; avoid creating full dense matrices in RAM.\n- Apply per-class thresholds + top-K fallback; cap to max_tags; sort tags by score before joining.\n- Write submission.csv, then zip; validate size and schema.\n\n5) Priority action checklist\n- Fix LinearSVC: dual=False; keep decision_function; increase max_iter. Add LR(saga) OvR and implement blended margins.\n- Reduce scope to feasible: rows 1–1.5M (then 3M if time), classes 12–15k (then 20k).\n- Replace full OOF memmap with per-class positive OOF collection; compute per-class high-percentile thresholds.\n- Decode with thresholds + K=3 fallback, max_tags=6; sort tags; write Id,Tags; zip.\n- Monitor: training wall-clock per fold, RAM/IO, avg predicted tags, submission size.\n\nThis synthesis favors OpenAI’s efficiency plan (LR baseline + blended margins + positive-only OOF + batching) while keeping Claude’s scale and blending emphasis; it drops infeasible full-data/huge-OOF approaches and preserves key comp-specific tricks (title upweighting, symbol-preserving tokens, per-class thresholds, top-K fallback).\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-23 10:19:23] Cell 7 in `main.ipynb` has been executing for 295s and is still executing.

Instead, I’ll set the JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER to a cache directory under the project. The previous cell was running, but the kernel was idle, leading to an error. I’ll also optimize the creation of Y_split by casting to np.int8 to save on memory and I/O. Let's proceed with editing Cell 7 to adjust those paths and streamline the code.**Preparing to run cell 7**\n\nI’m getting ready to execute cell 7, but I also need to check for existing files like cache/oof_svc.dat and test_svc_avg.dat from a previous partial run. It might be better to either remove or overwrite them. The code already has provisions for removing existing files, so we just need to use the edit_file function first before running it.

    "llm_json": "**Considering tool strategy**\n\nI need to choose one tool since cell 7 is executing, and it's building a dense label matrix again, which is slow. We've previously tried speeding this up with int8, but it's still slow because converting from sparse to dense is expensive and time-consuming. I realize the bottleneck lies here. We should change our approach to avoid a full dense Y_split and consider using iterative stratification instead. Maybe we can generate splits with a subset of rows or use mskf.split with a dense version of y just for splitting?**Optimizing multilabel processing**\n\nI can’t build a dense Y_split for multilabel, but I recall an expert suggested it earlier. However, it’s taking way too long to generate—15-30 minutes and still \"Building...\". It’s probably slow because of converting the large array. I think I can optimize this by using Y_use[:, split_cols].astype(np.int8).toarray() instead of the current method. Instead of fully densifying, maybe I should compute indices for each label to supply for iterative stratification. If KFold is an option, I could use that to move forward instead.**Optimizing MSkF speed**\n\nExperts emphasize MSkF, but it feels slow right now. I think I could reduce split_labels_cap to 50 or 100 to make the dense matrix smaller—5.4M x 100 would be around 540MB, which is heavy but faster. Reducing to 100 should speed things up 2-4x, which might be acceptable since they originally suggested 200. I need to interrupt the running cell first, then set split_labels_cap to 100. I could also use a memory-mapped array to help, although conversion will still be needed.**Implementing memory optimization**\n\nI can create an np.memmap file to efficiently handle memory usage while writing columns using .indices accesses. Even though msfk.split needs an ndarray, memmap is ndarray-like and should work. Here’s my plan: \n\nI’ll create an np.memmap at 'cache/Y_split_memmap.dat' with dtype=np.int8 and shape (n_samples, split_cap), initializing it with zeros. Then, I’ll set ones at indices where Y_use[:, col] isn’t zero. While this will take time, it can be more manageable than a full toarray conversion. First, I need to interrupt cell 7. Let's start with that!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"execute_code\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"code_execution_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"interrupt\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 7\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Interrupt to fix the bottleneck: building a 5.4M x 200 dense Y_split is too slow.

The oof and test memmaps should correspond to the Y_use columns based on the keep_cls from full frequency. We can deterministically recompute keep_cls using Y, as it's still in memory. I’ll modify Cell 8 to load kept_class_indices.npy; if it’s absent, I’ll recompute using Y and the top 20,000 classes. Also, I need to check for the test variable for id_col, which should be in memory.**Planning for threshold computation**\n\nI need to compute thresholds, and Cell 8 converts Y_use to CSC, which is a big transformation (5.4M x 20k).

Specifically, my X_tr in CSR format has int64 indices because of how scipy saves and loads data, while scikit-learn needs int32 indices. To fix this, I’ll convert the indices to int32. I can use methods like `X.asformat('csr')` and then adjust the indices and indptr accordingly. Additionally, I might write a helper function to ensure both X_full and Xt use the correct dtype after loading.**Ensuring int32 CSR format**\n\nI’m thinking about whether sorted indices are necessary, but they may not be. I plan to create a function called `ensure_int32_csr(X)` that converts the matrix to CSR, sorts the indices, and ensures both indices and indptr are in int32 format. I’ll apply this to both X_full and Xt before I use them. There’s also a consideration of memory usage: casting indices could require about 27.8 GB, given the size of the matrix. Am I really loading such a large sparse matrix?**Evaluating memory usage**\n\nThe size seems immense: with 6.9 billion non-zeros, the memory consumption could reach around 56 GB, which is significant, but still within our 440 GB limit. Since we've loaded it before, it’s already present. However, converting the index dtype will create copies near that size, which we need to consider carefully since the memory footprint will increase.

Is that sufficient to get \\u22650.71, or do you strongly recommend a tiny per-class F1 grid (e.g., 9 points) on OOF for a safer medal push under the time left? 4) If runtime looks tight, is it better to do 2 folds on 20k and proceed to test decode, or finish 3 folds on 15k? Objective: medal. Please advise the best course right now given ~7h remaining.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Executive call (with ~7h left):\n- Stop the current run. Relaunch as 2-fold, 20k classes. This is the highest-probability finish with medal-level score.\n\nWhy:\n- 20k x 3 folds risks timing out from where you are (no new memmap writes yet).\n- 2 folds preserves mid‑tail coverage (better than dropping to 15k) and fits in time.\n- Expected deltas: 15k vs 20k = −0.008 to −0.012 micro‑F1. 2 vs 3 folds = small hit, but outweighed by keeping 20k classes.\n\nCell 7 changes (do now):\n- n_splits = 2\n- Keep top_classes = 20000\n- LinearSVC: C=0.8, tol=3e-3, max_iter=400, loss='squared_hinge', dual=False, random_state=42, verbose=1\n- OneVsRestClassifier n_jobs=12 (keep your thread caps OMP/MKL/OPENBLAS=1)\n- Keep batched scoring (256), int32 CSR fix, and memmaps\n\nIf Fold 1 ETA looks >3h or RAM thrashes:\n- Option A: drop n_jobs to 10–8 and rerun (only if memory contention is clear).\n- Option B (if time becomes <4h after Fold 1): stick with 2 folds at 20k and finish; do not switch to 3x15k at that point.\n\nThresholding (Cell 8) – do this; it’s a cheap, reliable uplift:\n- Add a tiny per‑class F1 grid on OOF positives and pick best per‑class threshold.\n  - Percentile grid per class: [85, 90, 92.5, 95, 97.5] (use ~9 points if time).\n  - For classes with very few positives (<10), fallback to your high‑percentile median.\n- K fallback: tune K=2 vs K=3 on OOF; K=2 often wins. Keep max_tags cap (e.g., 6).\n- Expected gain over percentile‑only: +0.01 to +0.02 micro‑F1.\n\nAnswers to your questions:\n1) Go/No‑Go: No‑Go on 20k/3‑fold from current state. Relaunch 20k/2‑fold. 15k would finish but costs ~0.008–0.012 micro‑F1.\n2) Speed tweaks: Use C=0.8, tol=3e‑3, max_iter=400 on restart. Saves ~15–25% time with ≤0.002–0.005 micro‑F1 loss. Don’t change mid‑run.\n3) Thresholding: High‑percentile alone is risky; strongly add the tiny per‑class F1 grid for a safer medal push.\n4) Tight runtime tradeoff: Prefer 2 folds on 20k over 3 folds on 15k.\n\nSuggested schedule (fits ~7h):\n- 0–3.5h: Fold 1 train+score\n- 3.5–6.5h: Fold 2 train+score\n- 6.5–7.0h: Per‑class threshold grid, test decode, submit\n\nFinal checks:\n- Verify oof_svc.dat/test_svc_avg.dat are writing after Fold 1 fit.\n- Validate a small slice of submission (avg tags per test ~2.7–3.1, labels in kept set).\n- Submit. If a few extra minutes remain, try K=2 vs K=3 and keep the better OOF micro‑F1.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: fix the submission pipeline, use a scalable OvR-LR baseline, then blend with LinearSVC and optimize per-class thresholds. Keep features and class count within feasible limits, enforce strict decode caps.\n\nSynthesis of best advice\n- Immediate blockers (must-do now)\n  - Enforce output-size controls: max_tags ≤ 4–5, K_fallback = 2–3, deduplicate and sort tags. Target ~2–3 tags/sample to keep CSV <100MB.\n  - Tune thresholds on OOF scores; don’t submit before OOF micro-F1 is computed.\n- Modeling (medal-proven path)\n  - Primary: OneVsRest LogisticRegression(solver='saga', penalty='l2', C≈4, max_iter≈100–200). It scales and is strong.\n  - Blend: Add OneVsRest LinearSVC(dual=False, C≈1.0, max_iter≈1000) when LR is done; average decision scores (z-normalize per class before averaging). Optional third: SGDClassifier(loss='log_loss') for a small boost.\n  - Folds: 3–5 with MultilabelStratifiedKFold; keep your dense top-label trick for splitting.\n- Features (keep what works, trim to fit)\n  - Keep: title_repeat=3; token_pattern r'(?u)\\b[\\w\\+#\\.]{2,}\\b'; word 1–2g + char 3–5g; sublinear_tf=True; fit on train+test text.\n  - Make it feasible: body_maxlen 800–1000; word max_features 200k–300k; char 150k–200k; min_df 5–10. Alternatively use HashingVectorizer + TfidfTransformer to avoid huge vocabs/IO.\n- Class space (impactful and feasible)\n  - Train on top 25k–30k classes now (micro-F1 dominated by frequent tags). Expand toward all classes only if time/memory allow.\n  - Add a simple rare-tag rule: if an exact tag appears in the title (e.g., c++, c#, .net), force-include it.\n- Thresholding/decoding (where points come from)\n  - Compute per-class thresholds from OOF positives: try high percentiles (e.g., 90–97.5th) or a small sweep to maximize class-wise F1 (at least for frequent classes).\n  - Always have top-K fallback if no tag passes threshold; then cap to max_tags by top scores.\n  - Stream-write submission; avoid extra spaces; deduplicate tags.\n- Runtime/memory hygiene\n  - Avoid 6.9B-nnz matrices; rebuild smaller or use hashing. Batch class scoring; memmap OOF/test (float32, float16 if needed). Cap threads (BLAS=1, reasonable n_jobs).\n  - Monitor convergence; increase max_iter if warnings persist.\n\nConcise, actionable plan (24h)\n1) Rebuild features smaller (or switch to Hashing+IDF) with body_maxlen 800–1000, word 250k, char 200k, min_df 5–10; title_repeat=3.\n2) Train OvR LogisticRegression(saga, C≈4, max_iter≈150) on all rows, top 25k–30k classes, 3 folds; memmap OOF/test scores.\n3) Per-class thresholds: choose from 90/92.5/95/97.5th of positive OOF margins (or quick F1 sweep for frequent classes). Set K_fallback=2–3, max_tags=4–5.\n4) Submit (ensure CSV <100MB). If time remains, add OvR LinearSVC, blend scores (z-normalize per class), re-tune thresholds, resubmit.\n5) Optional: exact-match rule for ultra-rare tags in title.\n\nExpected outcome\n- LR(saga) + per-class thresholds + decode caps, 25k–30k classes: ~0.72–0.75 (bronze likely).\n- Blend with LinearSVC + better threshold tuning: +0.02–0.03 (solid bronze, flirting with silver)."

The instructions mention using only one tool per turn, so I’m focusing on editing Cell 8 for this. I’ll compute the per-class threshold using the F1 grid. Although computing F1 per class can be heavy due to negative counts, I can instead evaluate F1 on the overall validation OOF. The experts suggested using a tiny per-class grid on OOF positives for threshold selection.**Evaluating threshold computations**\n\nI realize that scanning all samples per class for each threshold involves an impractical number of operations—around 540 billion! Instead, I’ll compute thresholds per class using percentiles of positive OOF scores. For fallback tuning, I can compare K=2 and K=3 on a small validation subset. There’s a chance to sample negative rows to approximate F1, but it adds complexity. Considering the time constraints, I think keeping Cell 8 unchanged is best for now, but I could add the K=2 option.**Considering OOF micro-F1 calculation**\n\nI’m realizing that reading the entire OOF memory from disk is massive—about 400 GB. Since our memmap can’t load all that into RAM at once, I might need to threshold per batch to accumulate counts for true positives, false positives, and false negatives. The OOF will only be filled for validation rows, and since we didn’t save validation indices, it complicates the calculation of micro-F1.

Modifying while training seems beneficial, so I’ll make those adjustments to Cell 8!**Calculating micro-F1 metrics**\n\nTo compute micro-F1, I need to compare predictions against true labels on the out-of-fold (OOF) rows. This involves thresholding per class, binarizing predictions, and comparing them to the validation indices. However, the OOF memory contains only validation scores, so train rows that aren't in the validation set will remain zeros. This could cause bias. Since I didn’t save the OOF mask, I can deduce which rows have all-zero scores. Also, OOF scores could have negative margins — some might be zero, but never all classes at once.**Optimizing OOF calculations**\n\nI want to use an 'oof_rows_mask' to check for any nonzero values in oof_mem rows to identify validated rows. However, reading the entire oof_mem to compute the mask is a heavy task. Instead, I can scan row batches to minimize memory usage. But even scanning through 20k classes is iterative and might be too much. Given the time constraints, I think I won’t compute the OOF micro-F1. Instead, I'll focus on adjusting thresholds using only positive scores, setting K_fallback to 2. I'll also modify Cell 8 to cap the max tags, ensuring I keep the size manageable.**Modifying Cell 8 parameters**\n\nI’m planning to modify Cell 8 by setting K_fallback to 2 and adjusting max_tags from 6 to 5. I'll also include a top-K fallback method to pick the top-K scores even if there’s no threshold. To enhance thresholding, I might try a small per-class F1 grid using positive approximations from percentile lists, picking among them. I propose to narrow down the percentiles to [85, 90, 92.5, 95, 97.5].

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating folds and thresholds**\n\nI think the best immediate step is to re-run Cell 7, but since time is limited, I may only complete one fold instead of two. This means using an averaged test_avg over n_splits of 2 will half-scale, but scaling isn't strictly necessary. Training one fold gives only a partial test_avg, and dividing by n_splits affects the scores. I might consider adjusting the test_avg or using a top-K fallback for thresholds, though they would be based on limited data.**Modifying scaling logic**\n\nIn Cell 8, I realize we aren't accounting for scaling. It might be useful to modify it to detect how many folds have been completed, but that's not currently stored. Adding a parameter to scale test memmap by n_splits over num_completed could work, but we don't know that number. Given the time constraints, it might be better to adjust Cell 7 to use n_splits of 1 and fit the data directly. However, that could lead to errors with the current mskf setup. So I could alternatively focus on using heuristic percentiles for positives from training, but I'll need scores for validation.**Adjusting folds for test_avg**\n\nI’m considering performing a 1-fold holdout by setting n_splits to 2 but stopping after the first fold. I can adjust the code so that test_avg isn't divided by n_splits, using a variable folds_done instead. Our current code divides by float(n_splits), so I could simplify things by just dividing by 1.0. Running two folds would overcount, so given the time constraints, let's stick with one fold. I’ll modify the code to use denom = 1.0 for the loop, and we won’t average. Also, I need to prevent creating a large Y_split since it's already 100. I'll tweak Cell 7 to keep n_splits at 2 for test accumulation but divide by 1.0.**Modifying loop for quick completion**\n\nI want to save a flag that records used_n_splits=1 into a small text file, but I can't guarantee that only one fold will run. To ensure we get a usable submission quickly, I’ll modify the loop to break after the first fold. So, I’ll edit Cell 7 to set n_splits to 2 (though that’s irrelevant), break after finishing fold 1, and accumulate test_avg without dividing by n_splits. I could optionally write a file to indicate folds_done=1, but that’s not essential. I'll run Cell 7 and then Cell 8 to generate the submission. Hopefully, this will lead to a competitive score, but any submission is better than none!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 7,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"import os, time, numpy as np, scipy.sparse as sp\",\n      \"from scipy.sparse import load_npz, csr_matrix\",\n      \"from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier\",\n      \"from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\",\n      \"from iterstrat.ml_stratifiers import MultilabelStratifiedKFold\",\n      \"from joblib import parallel_backend\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Training config (expert-approved fast baseline, adjusted for 2-fold finish)\",\n      \"n_splits = 2\",\n      \"C_svc = 0.8\",\n      \"max_iter_svc = 400  #

Cells 2 and 3 were executed earlier, but I'm unsure if the kernel still holds those variable definitions. The last output indicates that Y was undefined when the kernel restarted. Since Cells 2 and 3 show output numbers, they have run earlier in this session, but maybe I should re-run them to ensure Y is defined before moving on.**Executing training cells**\n\nIt’s likely that Y is still defined, but I think it’s safer to execute Cell 7 now anyway. Before running such heavy code, best practices recommend an expert review, but I have limited time left. The training in Cell 7 is complex, as it's working with a massive dataset. I noticed we already have artifacts from a previous run, so I might not need to train again. Instead, I could execute Cell 8, since it depends on variables defined in prior cells.**Executing Cell 8 for submission**\n\nThe output from Cell 2 indicates it was executed in the current kernel, so I can now run Cell 8 to create the submission.csv. However, I don't see kept_class_indices.npy in the cache listing, only mlb_classes.npy exists. If it's missing, we can recompute it using Y, which is good. I also need to ensure that the memmaps correctly infer shapes and compute the number of classes from existing files, like oof_svc.dat and test_svc_avg.dat.

It looks like the kept_class_indices.npy file should be available after running Cell 7, but the previous run failed before it could save. Although there's a cache, it doesn't list the kept_class_indices.npy, which is concerning since that code should save it upon completion. If kept_idx_path is missing, I can attempt to reconstruct the mapping from memmap classes that correspond to the training phase. Without saved indices, I can only guess about the top 20000 used, but I can't use Y since it’s not defined due to a kernel restart.**Rebuilding Y by Re-executing Cells**\n\nI can re-execute Cell 3 to rebuild Y, which should be a quick step (it only took about 248.5 seconds earlier). To prepare, I need to run Cell 2 to load the data and then Cell 3 for preprocessing to define train, test, and Y.

    "llm_json": "**Optimizing the approach**\n\nI'm thinking about embedding class names into the cache during training, but I’m not sure if we need to keep_cls for decoding. To map class indices to tag names, I might assume the first n_classes of mlb.classes_, although that could be misleading. Instead, it seems like a better idea to compute frequencies by counting strings in train['Tags'] without constructing a full Y matrix. This will save memory and time. In Cell 8, if Y isn't defined, I can count tags and build a mapping dictionary efficiently.**Considering threshold calculations**\n\nI noticed that we used Y_use to get positive indices per class for thresholds, but we depended on positive OOF indices for per-class thresholds. Without Y, determining which rows are positive becomes tricky. One alternative could be selecting a percentile of OOF scores, though that might not be ideal. Instead, I could reconstruct per-class positives by scanning train tags and building a mapping from class to row indices. This approach is heavy for 5.4M rows, but focusing on the top classes could make it manageable. I’ll also consider memory constraints and check if using my 440 GB RAM can accommodate it.**Rebuilding efficient index structures**\n\nI’m finding a simpler way to rebuild Y without the extensive time that the MultiLabelBinarizer took in the past, which was 248.5 seconds. Instead, I can run a helper in cell 8 after cell 2 completes to compute frequencies and positive indices directly from train['Tags']. It makes sense to modify cell 8 by removing the dependence on Y. If kept_idx doesn't exist, I’ll compute frequencies using tag_counter and collect positive row indices by streaming through train['Tags'].

    "llm_json": "**Improving model submissions**\n\nI need to focus on enhancing our model to achieve a medal score. We’ve produced a submission, but it scored below expectations. With 3 hours and 19 minutes left, I know we can make some changes.\n\nFirst, I’ll work on calibrating thresholds better by tuning per-class thresholds through maximizing F1 scores. Then, I’ll see if we can blend scores with Logistic Regression probabilities if those cached files are available from previous runs. I know this could lead to improvements!**Verifying shapes and improving thresholds**\n\nI need to check the shapes to infer the number of classes for each memmap; they might differ, like 20,000 versus the full count. Do we have the necessary kept class indices for Logistic Regression (LR)? It looks like we didn't save them. The files oof_lr.dat and test_lr_avg.dat were created earlier, likely from a different run. \n\nWe need to find the common classes' intersection and infer the number of classes from file size, selecting keep_cls for SVC. Blending could be risky, so I’m considering optimizing decoding parameters instead.**Optimizing micro-F1 calculations**\n\nI’m thinking about whether micro-F1 can be treated per class independently. It seems micro-F1 can be estimated by summing true positives over total counts. This could lead to optimizing F1 for each class individually, which might help improve overall performance.\n\nCalculating per-class metrics using out-of-fold predictions across 5.4 million rows and 20,000 classes seems quite heavy. We have the pos_rows list, but lack indices for negatives. I could compute false positives by counting out-of-fold scores above a threshold and then precompute counts of scores for sampled thresholds.**Improving histogram calculations**\n\nI’m considering how to compute histograms and percentiles from the memmap columns for each class. While scanning all n_train data seems feasible with quantiles via np.percentile, calculating 20,000 percentiles over 5.4 million floats might be too intensive and slow. \n\nInstead, I think increasing K_fallback to 3 and max_tags to 7 could simplify things. I also plan to add a global threshold using the micro-F1 score. Since Y is defined and exists in memory, I could integrate that into my tuning process.**Optimizing thresholds and tuning parameters**\n\nI think I can find better per-class thresholds by adjusting them with a scaling factor. The current thresholds are based on the median of the top three percentiles of positive scores, but they might be too high.

By adjusting batch sizes and iterating over a small grid of scaling values, I can effectively tune parameters to improve performance.

To solve this, I can modify Cell 9 to use an evaluation subset without needing Y, similar to what was done in Cell 8. I can build a list of indices for the kept classes using tags. Since eval_idx is 200k, it’s feasible to scan those rows. I'll create a true_idx_list aligned to the eval rows and update Cell 9 accordingly. Then, I'll execute it while avoiding the re-creation of memmapped variables.**Implementing Tag Mapping**\n\nI need to implement the mapping for max_tags=7. After identifying eval_idx, I’ll build a map that parses the train['Tags'] string for each selected row, similar to the approach in Cell 8. I’ll create tag_to_keptpos using all_classes[keep_cls]. \n\nThen, I’ll set up true_idx_list as a list of numpy arrays. Instead of using Y_use in eval_setting, I’ll utilize true_idx_list with offsets to retrieve global indices. I'll compute metrics in the same way.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating submission strategy**\n\nI realize we can only use one tool at a time, so if we ask for a review, I can’t submit right now. It might be worth resubmitting to see if the score improves, but our previous tuning showed terrible micro-F1, which likely made the score worse. I think it’s better to return to the old submission settings with max_tags=6, K=2, and scale 1.0, then regenerate using the original thresholding settings. This should take about 20 minutes.**Optimizing submission process**\n\nI’m considering a quick fix by modifying cell 9 to set best_scale=1.0 and best_k=2, ignoring the tuning. This way, I can run the regeneration part quickly, using existing thresholds and writing the submission in about 6 minutes. The tuning cell has logic that will help, so I’ll create a new cell 10 to write the submission with max_tags=6, K=2, and thr_scale=1.0. Let’s proceed to insert cell 10 and execute. Should I request an expert review? It's recommended but not necessary. Speed is key, so I'll implement it.**Adding and executing cells**\n\nI need to remember that I can only use one tool per turn.

    "llm_json": "**Investigating training alignment**\n\nI see that the OOF memmap corresponds to keep_cls at the time of training, and I’m wondering if our recomputed keep_cls from tags differs due to a file. We saved kept_class_indices.npy at training's end with a timestamp. That should keep things aligned. But why is the micro-F1 so low? The OOF memmap for a single fold has only that fold's validation filled, while other rows are zeros. This might contaminate calculations when considering OOF scores.**Analyzing threshold calculations**\n\nI’m realizing that our code for thresholds only takes positive rows, but many of those contain zeros because they weren’t validated. This could lead to thresholds around zero, resulting in many predictions being included. My micro-F1 tuning shows low true positives and a huge number of false positives, which might suggest the thresholds are set too high. If pos_scores contain mostly zeros, the 95th percentile would also be zero, pushing the threshold to zero. To get accurate per-class thresholds from OOF, we should focus only on rows from the validation fold.**Reconstructing validation indices**\n\nSince we completed just one fold, those rows relate to a specific validation index (va_idx). I realize we need to save those indices for effective thresholding on a per-class basis, focusing on positive rows that intersect with va_idx. Unfortunately, we didn’t save va_idx, but I can reconstruct it by checking for any non-zero scores in the OOF memmap. Scanning 5.4 million x 20k is heavy, so I’ll read chunks to create a validation mask based on non-zero values. Then, I can efficiently compute thresholds using only the relevant positive rows from the validation mask. Let's implement that adjustment in Cell 8!**Modifying row selection**\n\nWhen I'm building pos_rows, I’ll only include a row if val_mask[irow] is True to avoid zeros. After that, I will recompute the thresholds and regenerate the submission, which should help improve them. I’m thinking about setting K_fallback to 3 and max_tags to 7, like before. Since time is of the essence, it’s time to modify Cell 8. I need to execute the edits to compute val_mask and use the saved keep_cls file without recomputing, so if kept_idx exists, let’s avoid that step.

    "llm_json": "**Considering tool usage and optimization**\n\nI need to decide on a single tool to use. Currently, there's a lengthy recomputation running that will take over 2 hours, and it might be better to let it finish. Sleeping while waiting seems wise, but I should also get an expert review at major milestones, which I may have overlooked.\n\nAlternatively, interrupting could allow me to adjust the row batch size for faster processing, though I need to keep in mind the memory limitations. Processing 5.4 million rows in batches of 20,000 could lead to considerable resource usage.**Evaluating validation and scanning methods**\n\nI see we have a limited number of nonzero rows for the validation set, which could be around 2.7 million. Since we're scanning everything, perhaps a better method would be using `np.fromfile`. Loading a small indicator for each row could help, as it would require reading fewer columns.\n\nBut computing across 20,000 classes still needs scanning all columns, and tracking validation rows during training is too late now. Since it’s already running, I think we should let it continue, but I’m concerned about the speed with 36 vCPUs and SSDs.**Reassessing validation row detection**\n\nConsidering the risk, it seems best to adjust our approach. Instead of reading all columns to find validation rows, I could check for nonzero values in the out-of-fold rows by applying a threshold on absolute values, reading in chunks like before. Unfortunately, I can't completely avoid checking all columns.\n\nAn alternate option is to reconstruct validation indices from our earlier splits, but I didn't save the indices. I could re-run a light recomputation of the split indices without loading the large matrices that caused issues before.**Regenerating split indices for validation**\n\nI can regenerate the split indices by using the MultilabelStratifiedKFold on the top 100 labels in dense format. Since I have the Y matrix cached as sparse, I can extract the relevant columns and create a dense array from the top 100 labels, which should be manageable.\n\nAlthough it was a bottleneck earlier, we’re not in the training phase now, so I think it should go more smoothly. Using the same random state with mskf should give me the same validation indices, allowing me to compute the val_mask effectively without scanning the out-of-fold data. So, I’ll interrupt the current process to focus on this.**Planning for faster validation process**\n\nThis approach will definitely speed things up, so let's go for it! I'll need to ensure that iterative-stratification is installed, which it is. I have the Y matrix in memory from Cell 3, and I can access the keep_cls data from the cache. \n\nNext, I’ll create Y_use by selecting the relevant columns and then generate a dense matrix for Y_split. I’ll use mskf.split to get the validation indices and adjust the val_mask accordingly. I'll compute the positive rows and the thresholds, and then write the submission. \n\nThe next step is to edit Cell 8 to replace the out-of-fold detection with this recomputation. I need to ensure the split parameters match those used during training. First, though, I'll interrupt the current execution so that I can make these changes. Let's do that!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"execute_code\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"code_execution_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"interrupt\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 8\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Interrupt Cell 8 to avoid slow OOF memmap full scan.

It might be that the code wasn’t executed after a kernel restart.**Evaluating model adjustments**\n\nI see the OOF had zeros, and the thresholds used positive scores based on tags were also zeros. This led to issues in our submissions, which were poor. With the time we have left, I think we could switch to a Logistic Regression probabilities model, which might perform better. I have cached files that could be from a smaller run. Maybe loading precomputed test predictions and applying a simple top-K heuristic might help us improve beyond the problematic thresholds we faced earlier.**Reassessing thresholds and predictions**\n\nI realized we set the threshold to infinity by default, but computed positive values resulting in zeros, making many predictions difficult to interpret. Since there's no time to retrain the model, I think we should create a robust decoding method that doesn't depend on OOF. I’m considering using a small global threshold to select about three tags per sample and applying a top-K approach for each row. Blending SVC margins with Logistic Regression probabilities could also help, but I’m worried about class alignment and kept indices.**Implementing a new approach**\n\nSince the earlier per-class threshold method isn't working, I think I can create a new cell for submissions using a per-row top-K approach, maybe picking K=3. I'll set up Cell 11 to write the submission based on the top-3 picks from the test averages. This might help us avoid those bad thresholds and improve our scores. I also want to ensure that the kept class indices match. Once I write the top-3 submission, I need to execute and submit it.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating current performance**\n\nI need to take the next steps because we have about 2:15 left, and our current performance did not medal. The timestamp from oof_svc.dat indicates it’s from an earlier run, which explains why there are zeros in the OOF memmap—probably because we were unable to rerun cell 7 due to a NameError. However, we can blend LR predictions with SVC margins, using cache files from our previous runs, though they might not match the current classes available.**Analyzing class detection**\n\nI’m considering if we can detect the class count by the memmap size and load mlb_classes, although we need to align their kept indices, which is currently unknown. For that smaller run, we had the top 1000 classes, but we didn’t save their indices. I think I can reconstruct the top 1000 tags based on frequency from the full labels and get the intersection with the 20k keep_cls, creating a blended score matrix for overlapping classes. It's a bit risky since I'm not sure about the order of classes in test_lr_avg.**Exploring scoring methods**\n\nI’m thinking about using quantiles to select an average of three per row, which relates to setting a dynamic per-row cutoff based on the Kth largest score, but that’s just the same as top-3. Maybe I could experiment with top-4, but that might hurt precision. Another idea is applying tf-idf logistic regression on precomputed features, but training could take too long. Given these constraints, it might be best to request expert review for a quick fix, like using normalized SVC decision scores through Platt scaling or using a prior bias for common tags.**Improving decoding implementation**\n\nI'm considering a quick way to enhance the decoding process by adding alpha times log of the frequency rank to the scores before selecting the top-K. I can compute class frequencies from the training tags and map them to the kept classes, then apply top-3 on those adjusted scores. To implement this, I could create a submission cell focused on blending frequency priors. Setting a small alpha and considering rank-based adjustments for frequent tags might help refine our approach. Alternatively, calibrating per-row K based on margin gaps could also provide modest improvements.**Requesting expert review**\n\nIt seems like the leaderboard (LB) isn’t looking great, but I feel we still need to try. Closing unnecessary files might help, and our performance health seems fine. I think it’s a good idea to request an expert review for last-mile decoding tips focused only on margins. I want to ask about maximizing micro-F1 given we only have test_svc_avg for the top 20k classes, and I’ll include the need for prior blending and K strategy. I’ll use request_expert_review with the main.ipynb filepath and an explanation.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Context: We have cached test SVC decision scores for top 20k classes (cache/test_svc_avg.dat) and class names (cache/mlb_classes.npy) with kept indices (cache/kept_class_indices.npy). OOF memmap (cache/oof_svc.dat) appears all-zero (likely due to an earlier interrupted/old run), so per-class thresholding from OOF is unreliable. We produced submissions using: (1) per-class thresholds computed from tag positives built from train['Tags'] (but contaminated by zero OOF), (2) baseline per-class thresholds with K=2 fallback, and (3) an emergency per-row Top-3 decode. None medaled. We have ~2h15m remaining. Ask: With only test SVC margins and access to train tag frequencies, what is the best last-mile decoding to maximize micro-F1? Options I'm considering: 1) Prior-augmented Top-K: add a tag-frequency prior (e.g., add alpha * log(freq) or z-scored freq) to SVC margins before selecting K; tune alpha small. 2) Dynamic K per row using margin gaps: choose K in {2..6} based on drop between kth and (k+1)th scores. 3) Calibrate a global threshold using the distribution of positive vs negative margins heuristically (e.g., set threshold at a high quantile per class using only train positives but restricted to a proxy validation mask). Given OOF is unusable, which pragmatic decoding do medal winners use when stuck with only margins? Any recommended values for alpha, K range, margin-gap heuristics, or frequency prior functional form? Also, is blending SVC margins with LR probabilities feasible given we have test_lr_avg.dat (likely top-1000 classes) without saved class order? If yes, how to safely align columns quickly? Please provide the quickest-to-implement strategy likely to boost micro-F1 over plain Top-3 within ~60 minutes, plus parameter suggestions.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the fastest, safest path to lift micro-F1 over plain Top-3 within ~60 minutes, plus a backup if you still have >90 minutes to re-train.\n\nPriority A (no retraining, best last-mile decode from margins):\n- Do not use the current per-class thresholds (OOF is effectively all zeros).\n- Implement zscore+prior decoding:\n  - Compute a frequency prior over the kept classes: prior = alpha * zscore(log1p(freq_kept)), where freq_kept is built from train['Tags'] and mapped to cache/kept_class_indices.npy. Recommended alpha = 0.20 (try 0.15 and 0.25 only if time permits).\n  - For each test row:\n    - Row-wise z-score the SVC margins: Z = (row - mean)/std.\n    - Add the prior: Zp = Z + prior.\n  - Choose a single global threshold theta to match the expected average cardinality:\n    - Target avg tags per row ≈ 2.9 (acceptable 2.7–3.1).\n    - Search theta on a small grid, e.g., [-0.2..0.8]. Pick the theta whose predicted count (Zp >= theta) averages closest to 2.9.\n    - If you’re short on time, use theta = 0.30 as a robust default with alpha = 0.20.\n  - Fallbacks/caps:\n    - If none selected: Top-K with K=3.\n    - If only one selected: bump to at least 2.\n    - Cap to max_tags=6.\n- Why this: It’s the quickest robust gain without OOF, used by medalists. Row-wise z-scaling stabilizes score ranges; the tiny freq prior improves precision on common tags; matching the average tag count preserves recall. Expect +0.02–0.05 over Top-3.\n\nOptional variation (if you prefer dynamic K instead of global theta):\n- Prior-augmented Dynamic-K:\n  - Augment raw margins with a smaller prior (alpha ≈ 0.10).\n  - Sort scores; start K=3; increase up to K=6 while the normalized gap between rank k and k+1 remains small:\n    - gap = (s[k] - s[k+1]) / std(top 6 scores), add if gap < 0.2; stop otherwise.\n  - Same max_tags=6; this is also a solid boost and quick to code.\n\nOptional blend (only if trivial to align, otherwise skip):\n- If test_lr_avg.dat exists and you can reconstruct its column order as top-N by train frequency:\n  - Determine N = test_lr_avg.dat.shape[1]; set lr_keep = argsort(-freq_all)[:N]; map those classes to the SVC kept columns.\n  - Per-row z-score SVC and LR aligned columns separately; blend: 0.7*z_svc + 0.3*z_lr; then apply the same theta-based decode above. Reduce alpha to ≈0.15 when blending.\n- If mapping isn’t exact on first try, abandon this—misalignment silently hurts.\n\nPriority B (only if you still have >90 minutes to run training):\n- Your LinearSVC training cell didn’t actually run (NameError; stale memmaps). If you can afford a new run:\n  - Subsample to ~2.5M rows (random, fixed seed).\n  - Use that subset for the splitter, fit, OOF mapping back to original indices (oof_mem[sub_idx[va_idx], ...]).\n  - Slightly relaxed LinearSVC: dual=False, tol≈5e-3, max_iter≈300, C≈0.8.\n  - After fold 1 completes, you’ll have a usable OOF to compute per-class thresholds on validation rows only, then decode. This is more reliable but risks running long.\n\nParameters recap:\n- Zscore+prior: alpha = 0.20 (0.15–0.25), theta chosen to avg ~2.9, min_k = 2 (or 3), k_fallback = 3, max_tags = 6.\n- Dynamic-K: alpha = 0.10, base_k = 3, max_k = 6, gap_thr ≈ 0.2 (normalize by row std).\n\nExecution tips:\n- Batch with memmap (e.g., 40–50k rows per batch).\n- Verify avg predicted tags after choosing theta; aim 2.7–3.1.\n- Submit this decode first; if time remains, try one alpha tweak and re-submit the better one.\n\nThis plan synthesizes what medalists do when OOF is unusable (prior-augmented re-ranking) and avoids risky thresholding from contaminated OOF.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: deliver a reliable TF-IDF + linear OvR pipeline that actually writes nonzero OOF/test scores, derives per-class thresholds from OOF positives, and decodes with a top-K fallback. Prioritize stability and throughput over complexity.\n\nWhat to fix now (root causes)\n- Training didn’t populate OOF/test scores: NameError on Y after restart; OOF memmap all zeros; per-class estimator loop fragile.\n- Feature scale too heavy; any hiccup yields empty outputs.\n- Thresholding used empty OOF; decoding fell back to top-K from untrained scores.\n\nMinimal winning pipeline (keep top 15–20k classes)\n- Vectorization\n  - Prefer HashingVectorizer + TfidfTransformer (row-batched) for reliability; or cap TF-IDF to ~500k total features and truncate body to 1–1.8k chars.\n  - Keep title_repeat=2–3; token_pattern r'(?u)\\b[\\w\\+#\\.]{2,}\\b'; add char 3–5 ngrams; sublinear_tf=True; fit once on train+test.\n- Model\n  - OneVsRest(LinearSVC) with C=0.5–1.0, dual=False, tol=1e-3–3e-3, max_iter=400–1000, n_jobs tuned; or OneVsRest(LogisticRegression SAGA, C=3–6). SGDClassifier(log_loss, alpha≈1e-6–3e-6) if time-tight.\n  - Score in row-batches with clf.decision_function(X_batch) to fill OOF/test directly; do NOT loop per-class over estimators_.\n- CV and splits\n  - MultilabelStratifiedKFold (1–2 folds under time). Build split on dense top 50–100 labels. Fit vectorizers once; reuse for all folds.\n\nThresholding and decoding\n- Per-class thresholds from positive OOF margins (validation rows only): use 90–97.5th percentile (e.g., median of [90, 95, 97.5]).\n- Fallback: if no predictions, force top-K (K=2–3). Cap per-sample max_tags to 6–7.\n- If no validation rows detected, fallback to a global threshold (0.1–0.3 tuned on a small OOF subset) + top-K.\n\nPerformance/memory hygiene\n- Ensure CSR indices/intptr are int32; X.sort_indices().\n- Use memmaps for OOF/test; verify nonzero slices after scoring.\n- parallel_backend('threading'); set OMP/MKL/OPENBLAS=1; set JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER to a writable path.\n- Limit classes to 15–20k by frequency.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Per-class estimator loops for scoring (order/empty-class bugs).\n- Global thresholds only; ignoring per-class thresholding.\n- Refitting vectorizers per fold; leaking/over-cleaning text; omitting char ngrams.\n- Submitting without checking OOF micro-F1.\n\nExecution plan (fast, dependable)\n1) Re-run preprocessing so Y, mlb, and cleaned text exist.\n2) Build features:\n   - Option A (safer): Hashing (2^20 word 1–2g + 2^18 char 3–5g) + TfidfTransformer on train+test (row-batched).\n   - Option B: Use cached TF-IDF but reduce to ~500k features total and body_maxlen≈1200.\n3) Keep top 15–20k labels by frequency.\n4) Train 1 fold:\n   - OvR LinearSVC (settings above). After fit, fill OOF/test by row-batch decision_function; confirm oof_mem has nonzeros in val rows.\n5) Compute per-class thresholds from positive OOF; save.\n6) Decode test with thresholds + top-K fallback; cap to 6–7 tags. Submit.\n7) If time remains: add a second fold (average test scores) or train OvR LogisticRegression and blend scores (z-score per class, average), recompute thresholds on blended OOF, resubmit.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Switch scoring to row-batch decision_function; stop looping over estimators_.\n- Ensure OOF memmap has nonzero validation rows before thresholding.\n- Use per-class thresholds from OOF positives; fallback top-K and global threshold only if needed.\n- Reduce risk: Hashing + TfidfTransformer or smaller TF-IDF; cap classes to 15–20k.\n- Submit after 1 solid fold; add folds/blend if time allows."

    "llm_json": "**Implementing zscore with frequency prior**\n\nI have expert advice suggesting we implement zscore with prior decoding. First, I should add a new cell to compute frequency priors from train['Tags'] mapped to the kept classes. For each test batch, I'll z-score the SVC margins, add the prior, and choose theta to either match the average of 2.9 or use default values of theta = 0.30 and alpha = 0.20. Implementing a quick grid may speed up the process. I’ll also compute frequency for all classes from train['Tags'] using efficient methods.**Building and standardizing data**\n\nI'll use a batch size of 200k to create a dictionary mapping tags to indices and increment the counts. Then, I'll compute a prior array of length n_classes using alpha times the z-score of the log1p of the frequency kept. For z-score standardization across classes, I need to compute the mean and standard deviation, handling cases where the standard deviation is zero. \n\nUsing numpy operations, I'll efficiently calculate z-scores row-wise and then add the prior. For theta, I'll either use the default of 0.30 or scan to find the average, implementing a fast grid by sampling.**Decoding process for Zp**\n\nI need to decode by evaluating each row and finding the indices where Zp is greater than or equal to theta.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating z-score implementation**\n\nI'm looking at the implementation of the expert advice involving z-score and prior decoding. In Cell 12, we picked theta based on the average tag count, resulting in theta = 0.80, which led to an unexpectedly high average of 40 tags for a 100k sample. The numbers printed seem like they could be counts per row, indicating a potential bug. It looks like the average counts printed might be missing a division step, which could skew the results significantly.**Analyzing count calculations**\n\nI’m investigating why the printed value shows 3154 instead of 3.154. It seems something might be off with how counts are summed—maybe across columns instead of rows? The total predictions should indicate average predictions per row. Since 3154 implies too many predictions, I'm curious if the \"seen\" variable is too small. It seems like the count shape might lead to a large scalar, and I need to clarify whether the average is computed correctly, especially with sample size and batch processing.**Investigating average calculations**\n\nI'm trying to figure out why the average is showing 3154 instead of 3.154, especially since a total of 315400 would make sense for that average. Could it be that the counts are per 100 rows because I didn't scale correctly? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding how numpy prints figures? I wonder if the count matrix could be boolean. Since the total calculations seem correct, I need to identify where a factor of 1000 could come into play, possibly linked to type overflow in numpy.**Reviewing theta calculations**\n\nI noticed that theta at 0.80 results in an average of 40 predictions per row, which seems quite large but maybe valid for a high threshold. There's potential confusion—it might have overlooked dividing by 100, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I wrapped up the z-score prior decode, yet it didn't medal with a remaining time of 1:52. Experts recommend tuning alpha to 0.15 or 0.25 and adjusting theta's default to 0.30 since my selection of 0.80 might be causing issues, especially with the weird average.**Fixing computation issues**\n\nI need to address the average calculation, ensuring it's based on rows instead of an overall total. It seems the bug might be due to using float32 with large arrays. A straightforward fix could be setting theta to the expert-recommended default of 0.30 and alpha to 0.20. I plan to implement a new Cell 13 to regenerate the results with theta=0.30. We can reuse the previous code for frequency counts, which should be quick, then decode and compute the average predicted tags over a 100k sample properly using the corrected method.

The goal is to adjust theta so the average becomes closer to 2.9.

This should enhance results. I'll create a fast function to calibrate theta with bisection using a sample of rows. \n\nI can define a function to compute the average count across 50k rows with precomputed Zp values.
