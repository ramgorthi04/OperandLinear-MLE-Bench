    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Great plan. Here’s a concise, medal-oriented synthesis with concrete defaults and guardrails to get you to ≥0.72 OOF quickly.\n\n1) Backbones, heads, training recipe (proven)\n- Backbones:\n  - Start: roberta-base (fast, strong). Target ≥0.715 OOF.\n  - Add if time: deberta-v3-base (usually +0.005–0.01 vs roberta-base).\n  - Only if slack: roberta-large (slower; small lift).\n- Head: simple QA start/end linear layers (no CRF/pointer needed).\n- Input format (Roberta): \"<s> sentiment </s></s> tweet </s>\" (sentiment as “question”, tweet as “context”).\n- Hyperparams (base models):\n  - max_len: 128 (96 also fine; 128 is safer).\n  - LR/schedule: AdamW, lr=2e-5 (base), 1e-5 (large), weight_decay=0.01, warmup_ratio=0.1, linear or cosine decay.\n  - Epochs: 3–4 with early stopping (patience 1–2, save best by fold Jaccard).\n  - Label smoothing: 0.05–0.1.\n  - Dropout on head: 0.1–0.2.\n- Decoding: maximize start_logits[i] + end_logits[j] (or start_prob*end_prob) for i ≤ j via O(N^2) search; it’s fast at 96–128 and reliably helps.\n\n2) CV protocol, leakage, max_len/truncation\n- CV: 5-fold StratifiedKFold by sentiment with fixed seed; good variance/bias trade-off.\n- Leakage/pitfalls:\n  - Build tokenization, offsets, and labels strictly within each fold (no global pre-tokenization or transforms).\n  - Don’t clean/lower/strip text used to compute char offsets (preserve original chars).\n  - Watch duplicates in EDA; rare, but don’t let same text cross folds if you find exact dupes.\n- Truncation:\n  - Keep full sentiment “question”; tweet context almost never exceeds 128. If you must truncate, truncate tail of context only and verify the gold span isn’t cut (skip/flag any that would be truncated during training).\n\n3) Post-processing (apply in this order; keep it minimal and validated on OOF)\n- Neutral → return full original tweet (biggest, most consistent gain).\n- Span validity: if start > end, set end = start (or fallback to full tweet).\n- Detokenize via offsets; trim only outer whitespace. Punctuation trimming helps in some setups—keep only if it improves OOF.\n- Empty/space-only guard: fallback (neutral → full; pos/neg → full or best unigram by logits).\n- Low-confidence fallback: if best span score < threshold (tune on OOF), fallback as above.\n- Repeated substrings: rely on offsets, not naive string.find at predict time.\n\n4) Data handling with RoBERTa byte-level BPE\n- Use tokenizer(..., return_offsets_mapping=True). Use sequence_ids() to isolate context tokens (ignore special/question tokens).\n- Build a binary char mask for selected_text [start_char:end_char) on the original text.\n- Label a token positive if its [tok_start, tok_end) overlaps the char mask. start_idx = first positive token; end_idx = last positive token. If none, choose tokens with max char overlap.\n- Common pitfalls:\n  - HF offsets are half-open [start, end); avoid off-by-one on right edge.\n  - Do not normalize text before label creation.\n  - Selected_text may occur multiple times; prefer the occurrence with best alignment (highest overlap) vs the provided span.\n\n5) Ensembling (high ROI)\n- Do first: 5 folds × 2–3 seeds for the main backbone.\n- Blend: average start/end logits across folds/seeds; then decode once on averaged logits. Optionally weight models by fold OOF.\n- Cross-backbone: add deberta-v3-base if time, blend logits with roberta-base (simple average or OOF-weighted). Min-cut/Viterbi didn’t consistently beat standard span search here.\n\n6) Baseline (sanity check)\n- Fastest: if sentiment == neutral → full tweet; else → full tweet. Expect roughly 0.47–0.60 depending on split. Add a light regex around negators/emphasis if you must, but don’t spend time—move to transformer ASAP.\n\n7) Training efficiency on A10 24GB\n- Batch sizes (FP16):\n  - Base: per_device_train_batch_size 32–48 at 128 tokens. Use grad_accum to reach effective 64–128 if desired.\n  - Large: 8–16 with accumulation.\n- Use torch.amp or HF Trainer fp16=True. Gradient checkpointing only if needed.\n- Epoch times: base ~10–15 min/fold/epoch at 128; full 5-fold × 3 epochs ~2–3 hours.\n- Early stopping: monitor fold Jaccard after PP decoding; patience 1 (min 2 epochs).\n\n8) Known LB/test quirks\n- More neutral and short tweets; your neutral→full and empty/short-span guards matter.\n- Emojis/URLs/mentions/hashtags common—do not aggressively clean or lowercase. Ensure UTF-8 safety. If you normalize URLs, only do it consistently at both train (for modeling) and inference and never before offset label creation.\n\nPractical defaults to implement now\n- Model v1: roberta-base, max_len=128, AdamW lr=2e-5, wd=0.01, warmup 10%, 3–4 epochs, label_smoothing=0.05, FP16, 5-fold stratified, O(N^2) span search.\n- PP v1: neutral→full, start≤end guard, whitespace trim via offsets, empty/low-confidence fallback to full.\n- Ensembling: 2–3 seeds × 5 folds (logit average). If ≥0.715 OOF, add deberta-v3-base (1–2 seeds) and re-blend.\n\nChecks and pitfalls to explicitly verify\n- Offsets/labels sanity: print a few random samples per fold with text, selected_text, tokens, offsets, computed start/end—manually verify.\n- Ensure no context truncation of gold spans.\n- Cache fold-wise logits and predictions; validate OOF Jaccard after PP.\n- Submission order/encoding mirrors sample_submission.csv.\n\nIf you want, I can provide a minimal HF tokenization/labeling snippet (with sequence_ids/offsets) and the O(N^2) decoding loop next.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Ship a valid baseline now; implement a QA-style span extractor (RoBERTa-base or DeBERTa-v3-base) with strict offset mapping; apply a neutral→full-tweet rule and minimal post-processing; use stratified 5-fold CV with OOF-driven tuning; ensemble folds/seeds (and a second backbone if time); verify metric/submission. Target OOF ≥0.72.\n\nTargets (OOF guide)\n- Heuristic baseline: ~0.63–0.67\n- Single QA base model: ~0.710–0.720\n- With tuned post-processing: +0.003–0.01\n- Seed/backbone ensemble: +0.005–0.015\n- Bronze threshold: ≥0.717 on LB\n\nImmediate priorities (today)\n- Build heuristic baseline with neutral→full rule; simple pos/neg keyword span or fallback to full tweet.\n- 5-fold StratifiedKFold by sentiment; compute Jaccard exactly like the competition scorer (no normalization; preserve case/whitespace/unicode).\n- Produce and submit a valid submission.csv (columns: textID, selected_text) to clear 0.000 and validate pipeline/encoding.\n\nCore model (QA span extractor)\n- Backbone: RoBERTa-base or DeBERTa-v3-base; max_len 96–128; fast tokenizer with offset_mapping; no text “cleaning.”\n- Labels: derive char mask for selected_text; map to token start/end via offsets; handle duplicate matches consistently; preserve casing/whitespace.\n- Head/loss: start/end cross-entropy; label smoothing 0.05–0.1.\n- Training: 5-fold stratified CV; AdamW; encoder lr 1e-5–2e-5, head lr 3e-5–5e-5; warmup 5–10%; cosine decay; 3–4 epochs; early stop on OOF Jaccard; mixed precision; optional multi-sample dropout and reinit top layers.\n\nDecoding and post-processing (biggest lever)\n- Decode span by maximizing start_logit[i] + end_logit[j] for i ≤ j; add a small length penalty to prefer concise spans.\n- Enforce non-empty, valid spans; if invalid/empty: neutral→full tweet; pos/neg→best single token or heuristic fallback.\n- Trim only leading/trailing spaces; avoid altering punctuation/hashtags/mentions unless OOF shows a gain.\n- Never include special tokens; ensure start ≤ end; detokenize strictly via offsets.\n\nValidation, metric, and analysis\n- Use deterministic seeds; fit transforms inside folds; cache tokenization/offsets/logits.\n- Monitor per-sentiment OOF (neutral should be ~near-perfect with the rule).\n- Do error analysis by sentiment and length; visualize predicted vs. true spans; adjust PP rules only when OOF improves.\n\nEnsembling (to secure/boost medal)\n- Average start/end logits across folds, then decode.\n- Add 1–2 seeds per backbone; optionally add a second backbone (e.g., RoBERTa-base + DeBERTa-v3-base); weight by OOF.\n- Aim for OOF ≥0.72 before final submit.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Offset misalignment from any cleaning/lowercasing or non-fast tokenizers.\n- Invalid/empty spans; start > end; including special tokens.\n- Metric mismatch (e.g., token-level or normalized Jaccard) vs. competition scorer.\n- Non-stratified CV or leakage (tuning PP on full train without OOF discipline).\n- Submission errors: wrong columns, encoding issues; losing unicode/whitespace.\n\nCompute/time strategy\n- Allocate time: ~20% EDA/baseline, 50% modeling+PP, 20% ensembling, 10% final checks.\n- If compute-limited: base models, fp16, gradient accumulation, 3 folds + 2 seeds can be close to full 5-fold.\n- Don’t waste time on heavy augmentation or aggressive text cleaning (breaks offsets); character-only models are lower priority.\n\nMilestone checklist\n- Metric parity + data sanity; valid baseline + first submission.\n- QA model v1 with strict offsets; OOF ≥0.715.\n- PP v2 (neutral rule, minimal trimming) verified on OOF; decode length penalty tuned.\n- Ensemble folds + seeds (+ second backbone if time); OOF ≥0.72.\n- Final checks (per-sentiment OOF, submission integrity) and submit."

    "llm_json": "**Implementing heuristic prediction**\n\nI need to add a baseline heuristic for submission quickly by inserting a new cell index to implement the prediction. I should consider a simple approach like using neutral to full tweet or picking positive/negative keywords. Experts recommend focusing on just the neutral to full and ensuring the submission pipeline stays intact. Maybe for the positive/negative, I could select a window around the most emotionally charged words? But honestly, keeping it simple might be best right now.**Considering submission strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about implementing the neutral to full or full strategy for predictions, which might result in a low Jaccard score around 0.5 to 0.6 as an initial submission. But I realize we don't submit yet—we just need to create a submission.csv. \n\nI have an idea to implement a simple heuristic: for non-neutral sentiments, I could pick the first and last occurrence of sentiment-bearing tokens from the tweet. But building a dictionary takes time. Since we want to move quickly, I think creating predictions based on this heuristic could help us measure cross-validation.**Implementing prediction function**\n\nI’m ready to define a function, `predict_span_heuristic`, that handles sentiment prediction based on several heuristics. If the sentiment is 'neutral' or the text is empty, I’ll just return the text. For positive sentiments, I’m considering choosing the longest word or looking for positive indicators like 'love' or 'great'. \n\nFor negative sentiments, I’ll check for the first occurrence of words like 'not' or 'hate'. If I find any tokens, I’ll return those; otherwise, I’ll return the original text. This feels like a practical approach!**Planning tokenization approach**\n\nI want to use regex to find indices and expand to token boundaries for matching. The plan is to tokenize by spaces, returning the matched word or exact emoticons. This feels like a solid and simple approach. After implementing this, I'll compute the heuristic Jaccard score on the training set to check for accuracy.\n\nOnce that's done, I can produce the submission.csv. I’ll also print the head and path, and I need to insert a new code cell at index 2 to set everything up. Then, I’ll execute it in the next step.**Implementing keyword extraction**\n\nI’m implementing a function called `find_keyword_span` to locate keywords in the text. The function will convert the text to lowercase and search for each keyword's index. If a keyword is found, it will return the substring. If no keywords are found, it returns None.\n\nFor the heuristic, if the sentiment is 'neutral', I’ll just return the original text. Otherwise, I’ll use the function to find the appropriate span based on positive or negative keywords. After that, I will compute the mean Jaccard score and apply it to the test data to produce 'selected_text' for the CSV.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 2,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Heuristic baseline: build quick OOF estimate and a valid submission\",\n      \"import re\",\n      \"\",\n      \"pos_keywords = [\",\n      \"    'love','lovely','awesome','amazing','great','good','best','glad','happy','yay','thanks','thank you','excited',\",\n      \"    ':)',':-)',':D','<3','lol','lmao','rofl'\",\n      \"]\",\n      \"neg_keywords = [\",\n      \"    \\\"n't\\\",'not','no ',' never','sad','bad','worse','worst','hate','angry','upset','sucks','tired','sick','terrible','awful',\",\n      \"    ':(',' :-(',' :/',' :|'\",\n      \"]\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def find_keyword_span(text: str, kws):\",\n      \"    if not isinstance(text, str) or not text:\",\n      \"        return None\",\n      \"    low = text.lower()\",\n      \"    for kw in kws:\",\n      \"        kw_low = kw.lower()\",\n      \"        idx = low.find(kw_low)\",\n      \"        if idx != -1:\",\n      \"            return text[idx: idx + len(kw)]\",\n      \"    return None\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def heuristic_selected(text: str, sentiment: str):\",\n      \"    if not isinstance(text, str) or not text:\",\n      \"        return ''\",\n      \"    s = (sentiment or '').strip().lower()\",\n      \"    if s == 'neutral':\",\n      \"        return text\",\n      \"    if s == 'positive':\",\n      \"        span = find_keyword_span(text, pos_keywords)\",\n      \"        return span if span else text\",\n      \"    if s == 'negative':\",\n      \"        span = find_keyword_span(text, neg_keywords)\",\n      \"        return span if span else text\",\n      \"    return text\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# OOF heuristic score on train\",\n      \"train_pred = train.apply(lambda r: heuristic_selected(r['text'], r['sentiment']), axis=1)\",\n      \"heuristic_oof = train.apply(lambda r: jaccard(r['selected_text'], heuristic_selected(r['text'], r['sentiment'])), axis=1).mean()\",\n      \"print(f'Heuristic OOF Jaccard (sanity): {heuristic_oof:.4f}')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Build submission\",\n      \"sub = test.copy()\",\n      \"sub['selected_text'] = sub.apply(lambda r: heuristic_selected(r['text'], r['sentiment']), axis=1)\",\n      \"submission_path = 'submission.csv'\",\n      \"sub[['textID','selected_text']].to_csv(submission_path, index=False)\",\n      \"print('Wrote', submission_path, 'Head:')\",\n      \"print(sub[['textID','selected_text']].head().to_string(index=False))\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\"\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Add a minimal heuristic baseline to validate end-to-end pipeline and produce a valid submission.csv.

Save best-epoch checkpoint per fold. In HF Trainer: evaluation_strategy='epoch', load_best_model_at_end=True, metric_for_best_model='jaccard'.\n\n6) Post-processing thresholds\n- Implement first: neutral → full tweet (already in decode).\n- Low-confidence fallback: tune on OOF. Use either\n  - best_score threshold from decode_one, or\n  - max(start_logits[ctx]) + max(end_logits[ctx]) < T.\n  Start with T around 0 and sweep on OOF; a percentile-based cut (e.g., bottom 2–5% best_scores) is robust.\n- Length penalty: small per-char 0.003–0.01; tune on OOF; disable if no gain.\n\n7) CV and leakage\n- 5-fold StratifiedKFold(sentiment) with shuffle=True, random_state=42 is correct.\n- Check duplicates; if present, prefer StratifiedGroupKFold with groups=text to avoid leakage. Otherwise standard StratifiedKFold is fine.\n\n8) Caching/logging\n- Save per-fold:\n  - val/test start/end logits as .npy\n  - offsets and sequence_ids (or re-tokenize deterministically at inference)\n  - decoded OOF predictions and per-fold metrics\n- This enables fast re-decoding for PP/threshold sweeps and blending.\n\nSmall sanity checklist\n- Always restrict to sequence_ids == 1 for labels/decoding.\n- Do not clean/lowercase text before tokenization.\n- Verify a handful of samples per fold by decoding token spans back to text.\n- Use truncation='only_second' and confirm targets aren’t truncated (or IGNORE_INDEX those rare cases).\n\nOnce you wire this, run 5-fold roberta-base, log OOF, and proceed to seeds/backbone blend if needed.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Pivot now to a QA-style transformer span extractor with rock-solid alignment, neutral handling, careful post-processing, and light ensembling. Target ≥0.72 OOF to clear bronze.\n\nPlan\n- Targets and focus\n  - Current ~0.59 is far from bronze (~0.717). Heuristics won’t bridge the gap.\n  - Aim OOF ≥0.72 (OOF→LB often +0.005–0.01). Use OOF to drive every decision.\n\n- Data and CV\n  - Drop the single null row(s). Keep the original text untouched for slicing.\n  - 5-fold StratifiedKFold by sentiment; fixed seed; compute/store OOF Jaccard.\n  - Build labels at character level: find selected_text span(s) in text; if multiple matches, take first; if no exact match, do minimal-normalization matching (lowercase, collapse spaces, normalize quotes) to locate, then map back to original indices.\n  - Cache tokenization and offset maps.\n\n- Model (QA-style span extraction)\n  - Input: “[CLS] sentiment [SEP] tweet [SEP]” (or equivalent for RoBERTa/DeBERTa). Predict start/end token positions.\n  - Backbones: start with roberta-base or deberta-v3-base; add roberta-large only if needed.\n  - Use tokenizer with return_offsets_mapping=True to map tokens↔chars.\n\n- Training settings\n  - Max_len 96–128; batch size ~32 (base) / 16 (large); epochs 3–5 with early stopping on CV.\n  - AdamW; lr 2e-5 (base), 1e-5 (large); weight decay 0.01; warmup ~10%; cosine or linear decay.\n  - Label smoothing 0.05 on start/end losses. Train 2–3 seeds. Use AMP for speed.\n\n- Decoding and post-processing\n  - Decode best span with start<=end maximizing start_prob*end_prob (or sum of logits). Consider a length cap for pos/neg (~≤30 tokens) with fallback to next-best pairs.\n  - Neutral handling: default to full original tweet (validate on OOF; this is a consistent gain).\n  - Convert via offset_mapping; slice exact substring from original text; only trim leading/trailing spaces (and optionally light edge punctuation) if OOF improves.\n  - Safety nets: if empty/invalid span, fallback to full text for neutral or a short highest-prob span for pos/neg; if pos/neg span covers >70–80% of tweet, fallback to a shorter high-prob span (tune on OOF).\n\n- Ensembling\n  - Average start/end logits across folds and seeds before decoding.\n  - If needed, ensemble two backbones (roberta-base + deberta-v3-base); weight by OOF. Expect +0.005–0.01 over best single.\n  - Optional: separate models for pos/neg (keep neutral as rule) for a small boost.\n\n- Quality checks and pitfalls\n  - Offset/tokenization misalignment is the #1 failure mode—test reconstruction thoroughly.\n  - Do not reconstruct text from tokens; always slice the original string.\n  - Keep max_len tight; long sequences add noise/cost without gains.\n  - Avoid aggressive trimming; only changes that raise OOF survive.\n  - Submission: exact columns [textID, selected_text], order preserved, UTF-8, no NaNs.\n  - Monitor stratification balance and seed determinism.\n\n- Expected performance\n  - Strong single (5-fold roberta-base + good PP): OOF ~0.713–0.716.\n  - +seeds/+deberta-v3-base or roberta-large and careful PP: OOF ~0.718–0.723 → bronze, often silver.\n\nImmediate actions (48–72 hours)\n1) Implement robust char-to-token alignment and 5-fold stratified CV; cache offsets.\n2) Train roberta-base QA (3–4 epochs, lr 2e-5, wd 0.01, warmup 10%, label smoothing 0.05).\n3) Decode with offset-based slicing; apply neutral→full rule; add minimal, OOF-validated trims and length caps.\n4) Add 1–2 more seeds; average logits across folds/seeds; reassess OOF.\n5) If OOF <0.715, add deberta-v3-base (or roberta-large) and ensemble by OOF weights; finalize."

For verification, I’ll loop over the five samples, call the tokenizer, and reconstruct from offsets using the start and end positions.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 4,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# QA setup: tokenizer, CV folds, and alignment sanity checks\",\n      \"import re, numpy as np, random, time\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\",\n      \"from transformers import AutoTokenizer\",\n      \"\",\n      \"SEED = 42\",\n      \"def seed_everything(seed=SEED):\",\n      \"    random.seed(seed); np.random.seed(seed)\",\n      \"seed_everything()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Drop nulls for label creation\",\n      \"train_clean = train.dropna(subset=['text','selected_text']).reset_index(drop=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Create stratified folds by sentiment\",\n      \"skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=SEED)\",\n      \"folds = np.full(len(train_clean), -1, dtype=int)\",\n      \"for f, (_, val_idx) in enumerate(skf.split(train_clean, train_clean['sentiment'])):\",\n      \"    folds[val_idx] = f\",\n      \"train_clean['fold'] = folds\",\n      \"print('Folds assigned:', np.bincount(folds))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"model_name = 'roberta-base'\",\n      \"tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, use_fast=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"IGNORE_INDEX = -100\",\n      \"def tokenize_and_align(tokenizer, text, sentiment, selected_text=None, max_len=128):\",\n      \"    enc = tokenizer(\",\n      \"        str(sentiment), str(text),\",\n      \"        max_length=max_len, padding='max_length',\",\n      \"        truncation='only_second', add_special_tokens=True,\",\n      \"        return_offsets_mapping=True, return_attention_mask=True\",\n      \"    )\",\n      \"    offsets = enc['offset_mapping']\",\n      \"    seq_ids = enc.sequence_ids()\",\n      \"    ctx_idx = [i for i, sid in enumerate(seq_ids) if sid == 1]\",\n      \"    start_pos = end_pos = IGNORE_INDEX\",\n      \"    if isinstance(selected_text, str) and isinstance(text, str) and ctx_idx:\",\n      \"        # find all occurrences; choose the one with max token-char overlap\",\n      \"        matches = [m.start() for m in re.finditer(re.escape(selected_text), text)]\",\n      \"        if matches:\",\n      \"            best = None\",\n      \"            for st_char in matches:\",\n      \"                ed_char = st_char + len(selected_text)\",\n      \"                overlap = 0\",\n      \"                for i in ctx_idx:\",\n      \"                    a, b = offsets[i]\",\n      \"                    overlap += max(0, min(ed_char, b) - max(st_char, a))\",\n      \"                if (best is None) or (overlap > best[0]):\",\n      \"                    best = (overlap, st_char, ed_char)\",\n      \"            _, st_char, ed_char = best\",\n      \"            chosen = [i for i in ctx_idx\",\n      \"                      if offsets[i][1] > offsets[i][0] and\",\n      \"                         max(offsets[i][0], st_char) < min(offsets[i][1], ed_char)]\",\n      \"            if chosen:\",\n      \"                start_pos, end_pos = chosen[0], chosen[-1]\",\n      \"            else:\",\n      \"                dists = [(abs(offsets[i][0]-st_char)+abs(offsets[i][1]-ed_char), i)\",\n      \"                         for i in ctx_idx if offsets[i][1] > offsets[i][0]]\",\n      \"                if dists:\",\n      \"                    start_pos = end_pos = min(dists)[1]\",\n      \"        # else: keep IGNORE_INDEX (rare)\",\n      \"    enc['start_positions'] = start_pos\",\n      \"    enc['end_positions'] = end_pos\",\n      \"    return enc, ctx_idx\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Sanity check a few samples per sentiment and fold\",\n      \"def reconstruct_from_positions(text, offsets, i, j):\",\n      \"    if i < 0 or j < 0: return ''\",\n      \"    s_char, e_char = offsets[i][0], offsets[j][1]\",\n      \"    return text[s_char:e_char]\",\n      \"\",\n      \"samples_checked = 0\",\n      \"for s in ['neutral','positive','negative']:\",\n      \"    df_s = train_clean[train_clean.sentiment==s].head(2)\",\n      \"    for _, r in df_s.iterrows():\",\n      \"        enc, ctx = tokenize_and_align(tokenizer, r['text'], r['sentiment'], r['selected_text'], max_len=128)\",\n      \"        pred_span = reconstruct_from_positions(r['text'], enc['offset_mapping'], enc['start_positions'], enc['end_positions'])\",\n      \"        print({'sent': r['sentiment'], 'text_snip': r['text'][:60], 'gold': r['selected_text'], 'recon': pred_span})\",\n      \"        samples_checked += 1\",\n      \"print('Alignment samples printed:', samples_checked)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('Setup OK.

    "llm_json": "**Planning training loop**\n\nI need to set up the training loop next, likely in a new cell, and incorporate the model and dataset using HF Trainer or a custom approach. Given the complexity, it's wise to work incrementally. I should start with the dataset class and model definition (using RobertaForQuestionAnswering could be helpful). I want to use HF Trainer with metrics like Jaccard. Plus, I'll need a data collator, training parameters, and to save predictions. So, I think I’ll prepare a skeleton for the training cell that handles 5-fold training.**Adjusting HF Trainer setup**\n\nI'm realizing that HF Trainer doesn't manage offsets by default, but I can work around this by storing them in the dataset features. For the evaluation loop, I’ll use a custom `compute_metrics` function where I'll decode based on the `EvalPrediction` object, which includes the predictions tuple (start, end) or logits. I'll also override the Trainer to access the dataset for decoding. To optimize speed, I'll stick with fixed max_len 128 instead of dynamic padding.**Preparing for training folds**\n\nI need to set up for each fold by splitting `train_clean` into training and validation indices based on the folds column. Next, I’ll create tokenized encodings for both the training and validation datasets, using selected text for position settings while storing necessary attributes like sentiment and offsets.\n\nI’ll then build a Torch Dataset class for tensor returning. The model I'll use is `AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('roberta-base')`. TrainingArguments will include settings like `fp16=True` and a batch size of 32. I'll also need a compute_metrics function to decode spans and calculate the Jaccard average against the gold selected text, storing logits for validation and test datasets. Phew, that’s quite a bit!**Implementing the training loop**\n\nI can start by implementing the core functionality for a single fold first, even though the instructions suggest a multi-fold approach. It’s fine to go ahead and create the training loop for five folds, including modest logging and caching outputs in .npy and CSV formats. I'll also implement the `decode_one` function as previously discussed. So, it looks like I need to insert a new code cell at index 5 for this setup.

Confirm this approach. 2) Metrics/dev loop: compute_metrics re-tokenizes to get sequence_ids/offsets each eval. Acceptable overhead? Or should I pre-store offsets/seq_ids for val to avoid drift? 3) Label smoothing: AutoModelForQuestionAnswering doesn't have built-in label smoothing; skip for v1 or implement custom loss? Is skipping okay for \\u22650.715 OOF target? 4) Training args: add max_grad_norm=1.0 (grad clip), gradient_accumulation_steps (e.g., 2) to raise effective batch to 64; keep fp16=True; epochs=3; cosine vs linear schedule (currently none specified; Trainer will use linear if I add lr scheduler). Should I wire a manual get_cosine_schedule_with_warmup or rely on Trainer defaults? 5) Caching: I save OOF logits and decoded preds. Any other artifacts to cache (e.g., per-example offsets/seq_ids) you recommend? 6) Post-processing: length_penalty_per_char=0.003 in decode_one and no low-confidence fallback yet. Should I defer tuning until after OOF, or set a small fallback now (e.g., bottom 2% best_scores -> full text)? 7) Runtime estimate on A10-24GB for 5 folds x 3 epochs x bs 32@128 tokens: ~2\\u20133h.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Great setup. Here’s the minimal, high-ROI patch list for Cell 5 to hit a medal-ready v1.\n\nCritical fixes\n- Load best model per fold for test:\n  - After training each fold:\n    - trainer.save_model(f'fold{fold}_best')\n    - Optionally record path: best_ckpt = trainer.state.best_model_checkpoint\n  - Test-time loop:\n    - model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(f'fold{fold}_best').to(device)\n    - Average logits across folds as you do now\n- Remove the bogus sequence_ids in build_encodings:\n  - Delete enc['sequence_ids'] = tokenizer.sequence_ids()… (this is invalid there)\n  - Keep re-tokenizing for seq_ids/offsets in compute_metrics/decoding (deterministic and fine)\n\nTrainingArguments (stability + slight lift)\n- Add explicitly:\n  - gradient_accumulation_steps=2\n  - max_grad_norm=1.0\n  - lr_scheduler_type='cosine'\n  - warmup_ratio=WARMUP_RATIO\n  - seed=SEED\n  - per_device_eval_batch_size=BATCH_SIZE*2\n  - dataloader_num_workers=2\n- Keep fp16=True, epochs=3. No need to wire a manual scheduler.\n\nMetrics/dev loop\n- Re-tokenizing for seq_ids/offsets in compute_metrics is acceptable. Optional micro-speedup: precompute (seq_ids, offsets, texts, sentiments, trues) for val once per fold and close over them (you already have helpers; easy to add later).\n\nLabel smoothing\n- Skip for v1. You can reach ≥0.715 OOF without it. Add custom Trainer loss later only if needed.\n\nCaching\n- Keep OOF start/end logits and decoded preds (good).\n- Also save per-fold test logits to .npy (fast PP re-tuning without re-running models).\n- Save the best checkpoint path per fold (text file) for bookkeeping.\n\nPost-processing\n- Keep neutral → full text in decode (already correct).\n- Keep length_penalty_per_char=0.003 for v1.\n- Defer low-confidence fallback until after OOF; then tune a percentile threshold (e.g., bottom 2–5% best_scores → full text) on OOF. Consider light punctuation trim only if it improves OOF Jaccard.\n\nRuntime/speed\n- Your 2–3h estimate on A10-24GB is reasonable.\n- Keep max_len=128 for v1. If you need faster iteration later, try 96 on one fold first (usually small or no drop, faster).\n\nSanity checks\n- Ensure submission order by textID, no NaNs.\n- Keep fold ordering consistent when concatenating OOF logits/preds.\n- Don’t normalize/alter text before offset decoding.\n\nMinimal code diffs (Cell 5)\n- TrainingArguments:\n  - add: gradient_accumulation_steps=2, max_grad_norm=1.0, lr_scheduler_type='cosine', warmup_ratio=WARMUP_RATIO, seed=SEED, per_device_eval_batch_size=BATCH_SIZE*2, dataloader_num_workers=2\n- After trainer.train():\n  - trainer.save_model(f'fold{fold}_best')\n- Test loop:\n  - replace model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('roberta-base') with model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(f'fold{fold}_best').to(device)\n- build_encodings:\n  - remove enc['sequence_ids'] = tokenizer.sequence_ids()…\n- Optional: cache per-fold test logits: np.save(f'test_start_fold{fold}.npy', starts), same for end.\n\nLaunch checklist\n1) Apply the above diffs (especially the test-loading bug and TrainingArguments).\n2) Start training; log per-fold OOF and elapsed time.\n3) If OOF ≥0.715: consider a second seed and average logits. If <0.71: try DeBERTa-v3-base or add label smoothing in v2.\n4) After OOF, sweep length_penalty and add a low-confidence fallback tuned on OOF.\n\nYou’re good to launch. Expect ~0.70–0.72 OOF with these patches.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: fix the QA training/inference pipeline, add robust post-processing, and, if needed, switch to a stronger backbone and ensemble.\n\n- Critical fixes now\n  - Train the QA model and use best checkpoints for inference.\n    - After trainer.train(): best_ckpt = trainer.state.best_model_checkpoint.\n    - For test, load AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(best_ckpt) per fold and average start/end logits.\n  - Compute metrics = Jaccard on decoded spans; set load_best_model_at_end=True, metric_for_best_model='jaccard', greater_is_better=True.\n  - Decode with fast tokenizer offsets; recompute sequence_ids via tokenizer(sentiment, text, ...) at decode time. Mask logits to context tokens only.\n\n- Post-processing and decoding (biggest gains)\n  - Neutral → return full tweet.\n  - Use offsets to slice original text; do not detokenize via tokenizer.decode.\n  - Top-k span search: consider top-k starts/ends (e.g., k≈20), enforce j>=i, cap span length (e.g., ≤30 tokens), prefer 1–10 words.\n  - Length prior: subtract length_penalty_per_char (grid 0.002–0.008) from start+end score.\n  - Confidence fallback: if best score below a tuned threshold, or span empty/punctuation/very short, return full tweet.\n  - Light trimming: strip leading/trailing spaces; optionally strip trailing standalone punctuation if OOF improves.\n  - Validate span is in text; if not, fallback to full tweet.\n\n- Training recipe (single model should approach bronze)\n  - Backbone: start with microsoft/deberta-v3-base (often > RoBERTa-base); use roberta-large/deberta-v3-large if VRAM allows.\n  - 5-fold StratifiedKFold by sentiment; MAX_LEN=128; per-device batch 16–32; fp16; grad_clip=1.0.\n  - LR 2e-5 to 3e-5 (base), 1e-5 to 2e-5 (large); epochs 3–4; warmup 10%; weight decay 0.01.\n  - Regularization: label smoothing 0.05–0.1; dropout 0.1–0.2.\n  - Save per-fold OOF logits and per-sentiment OOF to guide PP and weighting.\n\n- Ensembling (pushes you over the line)\n  - Average start/end logits across folds; optionally weight folds by OOF.\n  - Add 1–2 extra seeds for the same backbone; optionally add a second backbone (e.g., RoBERTa-base + DeBERTa-v3-base).\n  - If close to threshold, blend backbones by OOF-optimized weights.\n\n- Error analysis → targeted PP tuning\n  - Inspect OOF by sentiment and length. Typical errors: overlong spans for pos/neg; boundary punctuation; duplicate substring occurrences.\n  - Adjust length penalty, confidence threshold, and punctuation trimming using OOF.\n\n- Hygiene and gotchas\n  - Don’t normalize/lowercase text; offsets will break.\n  - Always use return_offsets_mapping and slice original text.\n  - Clear GPU between folds (gc.collect, torch.cuda.empty_cache).\n  - Submission: CSV with textID,selected_text; UTF-8; handle empty strings gracefully.\n\n- Minimal path to bronze\n  1) Patch checkpoint loading; run 5-fold QA with DeBERTa-v3-base.\n  2) Implement neutral→full, top-k decoding, length penalty (tune 0.002–0.008), confidence fallback.\n  3) Target OOF ≥0.715 (aim ≥0.72 for safety); log per-sentiment OOF.\n  4) Average logits across folds; if OOF <0.715, add a second seed and/or roberta-large; weight by OOF.\n  5) Submit."

The fastest option is to switch the backbone, taking around 2-3 hours for training. Since previous training was impressively quick, we can experiment more efficiently. I'll set up a new cell for this adjustment and ensure the tokenizer is updated appropriately.**Planning model execution**\n\nI’m thinking about writing a new cell to define a function that runs a model based on the given model name to produce OOF and submissions. Alternatively, I could duplicate current cell 5 and just change the model name variable for different outputs. To speed things up, I’ll implement a new cell 6 with this variable, re-initialize the tokenizer, and rerun folds. I might also tune the length penalty using the saved OOF logits and potentially improve our score from 0.70866 to around 0.711. For reaching ≥0.717, a better backbone will likely be necessary. Later, I can ensemble the logits from roberta and deberta too.**Planning OOF and blending**\n\nAfter training, the first step is to compute the OOF. If it's greater than or equal to 0.715, that might be acceptable. I’ll need to average the test logits from previous runs and write the submission with distinct filenames. For blending predictions, I plan to average the start and end logits from both models and decode them. For evaluating the ensemble, I’ll need OOF logits from both models, saving the new run’s OOF for DeBERTa. \n\nThen I’ll add a cell for DeBERTa training before execution. Given the space constraints, I need to keep it concise and ensure to install the DeBERTa v3 tokenizer since it’s supported by transformers; no extra packages will be needed.**Setting up DeBERTa model**\n\nI’m going to implement the variable `MODEL_NAME` and set it to 'microsoft/deberta-v3-base'. Next, I’ll initialize the tokenizer using `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` with the `use_fast` option enabled. Then, I’ll load the model with `AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained` using the same model name. I need to save the artifacts with the suffix 'deberta_v3_base' and ensure the model directories are labeled as `foldX_best_deberta`. Now, I'll prepare to edit the file to insert this new cell.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 6,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# DeBERTa-v3-base 5-fold QA training (expect +0.005\\u20130.01 OOF vs RoBERTa), same pipeline\",\n      \"import os, gc, math, json, time, numpy as np, pandas as pd, torch\",\n      \"from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, Trainer, TrainingArguments, default_data_collator\",\n      \"\",\n      \"MODEL_NAME = 'microsoft/deberta-v3-base'\",\n      \"print('Loading tokenizer/model:', MODEL_NAME, flush=True)\",\n      \"tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME, use_fast=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\",\n      \"MAX_LEN = 128\",\n      \"BATCH_SIZE = 32\",\n      \"EPOCHS = 3\",\n      \"LR = 2e-5\",\n      \"WARMUP_RATIO = 0.1\",\n      \"WEIGHT_DECAY = 0.01\",\n      \"GRAD_CLIP = 1.0\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def build_encodings_df(df: pd.DataFrame, include_labels: bool = True):\",\n      \"    enc_list = []\",\n      \"    for _, r in df.iterrows():\",\n      \"        sel = r['selected_text'] if include_labels else None\",\n      \"        enc, _ = tokenize_and_align(tokenizer, r['text'], r['sentiment'], sel, max_len=MAX_LEN)\",\n      \"        enc['text'] = r['text']\",\n      \"        enc['sentiment'] = r['sentiment']\",\n      \"        enc_list.append(enc)\",\n      \"    keys = enc_list[0].keys()\",\n      \"    out = {}\",\n      \"    for k in keys:\",\n      \"        vals = [e[k] for e in enc_list]\",\n      \"        if k in ('text','sentiment'): out[k] = vals\",\n      \"        else: out[k] = np.array(vals, dtype=object if k=='offset_mapping' else None)\",\n      \"    return out\",\n      \"\",\n      \"class QADataset2(torch.utils.data.Dataset):\",\n      \"    def __init__(self, enc, with_labels): self.enc, self.with_labels = enc, with_labels\",\n      \"    def __len__(self): return len(self.enc['input_ids'])\",\n      \"    def __getitem__(self, idx):\",\n      \"        item = {\",\n      \"            'input_ids': torch.tensor(self.enc['input_ids'][idx], dtype=torch.long),\",\n      \"            'attention_mask': torch.tensor(self.enc['attention_mask'][idx], dtype=torch.long),\",\n      \"        }\",\n      \"        if self.with_labels:\",\n      \"            item['start_positions'] = torch.tensor(self.enc['start_positions'][idx], dtype=torch.long)\",\n      \"            item['end_positions'] = torch.tensor(self.enc['end_positions'][idx], dtype=torch.long)\",\n      \"        return item\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def get_seq_ids_offsets(sentiment: str, text: str):\",\n      \"    tmp = tokenizer(str(sentiment), str(text), max_length=MAX_LEN, padding='max_length', truncation='only_second',\",\n      \"                    add_special_tokens=True, return_offsets_mapping=True)\",\n      \"    return tmp.sequence_ids(), tmp['offset_mapping']\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def decode_span(start_logits, end_logits, offsets, sequence_ids, text, sentiment, length_penalty_per_char=0.003):\",\n      \"    if str(sentiment).strip().lower() == 'neutral': return text\",\n      \"    ctx = [i for i, sid in enumerate(sequence_ids) if sid == 1]\",\n      \"    if not ctx: return text\",\n      \"    sl = np.asarray(start_logits, dtype=np.float32);

We can recompute those from the logits by re-tokenizing each train_clean row for offsets and decoding with different parameters. This is feasible offline on a CPU. I'll insert a cell to perform a post-processing sweep on the roberta OOF logits and compute an improved OOF. We can also apply the same process to the average test logits, which we've computed previously.**Setting up OOF computation**\n\nI plan to add cell 7, which will load the OOF start and end logits while ensuring their order aligns with the OOF dataframe rows since we appended in order. For each row in the OOF dataframe, I’ll recompute the seq_ids and offsets using the correct roberta-base tokenizer. I need to define a function to compute the best score and decode with specific length penalties. I'll sweep through varying length penalty values and fallback percentiles to identify the best OOF, then apply it to the test logits for submission.**Implementing PP tuning**\n\nWhile the deberta training is ongoing, I think we can take this opportunity to run the PP tuning step and potentially improve our score from 0.7087 to around 0.712, which sounds great! I’ll use the edit_file function to insert a new cell and execute it afterward. I want to implement functions that compute the best score while considering a low-confidence fallback for sentiment analysis.

I think it might be wise to ask for an expert review since it’s a key moment before significant code changes. I'll check if our plan is optimal and inquire about specific PP tricks, including tuning ranges and handling spaces. So, I’ll request expert feedback now.**Requesting expert review**\n\nI want to suggest enabling faster decoding with precomputed offsets per row, but it might be too late for that. I’ll request an expert review to explain our current progress: the DebV3 folds 0-2 are completed, and I'm debating whether to keep training or pause for PP tuning with Roberta. Since only one cell can run at a time in this environment, I’ll ask about ensembling techniques and any constraints on punctuation. I’m ready to send the request for feedback!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Status check and decision gate. Current state: RoBERTa-base 5-fold completed, OOF 0.70866 with cached OOF/test logits. DeBERTa-v3-base 5-fold is running in Cell 6; fold OOFs observed so far ~0.716 (f0), ~0.707 (f1), ~0.718 (f2), currently training fold 3. A PP tuning cell (Cell 7) for RoBERTa OOF logits is staged but not executed; executing it requires interrupting the DeBERTa run due to single-active-cell constraint.\\n\\nQuestions for medal-oriented guidance:\\n1) Should we let DeBERTa finish vs. interrupt now to run RoBERTa PP tuning? If DeBERTa is expected to yield \\u22650.717 OOF overall with our current setup (3 epochs, bs=32, grad_accum=2, fp16, cosine, lp=0.003 during decoding, neutral\\u2192full tweet), we prefer to let it finish. Otherwise, advise if we should stop and run PP tuning immediately to iterate faster.\\n2) Post-processing tuning: Are our two knobs sufficient/high-leverage? (a) length_penalty_per_char grid [0, 0.002\\u20130.008]; (b) low-confidence fallback threshold defined via OOF score percentile and applied to test. Any additional safe PP you recommend that tends to improve Jaccard here, validated OOF? e.g.,\\n   - Always predict full text for neutral (we already do).\\n   - Trim leading/trailing spaces only (or basic punctuation like quotes) when reconstructing.\\n   - Enforce start<=end and avoid empty strings (fallback to full text).\\n   - Short-text guardrails (e.g., if tweet length \\u2264 3\\u20134 tokens, return full text except when the model selects all but one token).\\n   - Constraining spans to context tokens only (we already mask non-context tokens).\\n   - Using softmax temperature scaling on logits before span scoring.\\n3) Ensembling plan: We intend to average start/end logits across folds and across backbones (RoBERTa + DeBERTa), then decode with tuned PP. Is simple equal-weight averaging good here, or do you suggest weighting by each backbone\\u2019s OOF (e.g., 0.45 RoBERTa, 0.55 DeBERTa) or by per-sentiment weights? Any proven blend tricks for this competition (e.g., geometric mean of softmax start/end distributions vs. arithmetic mean of raw logits)?\\n4) Decoding: Is our O(N^2) sum(start_i + end_j \\u2212 lp*len) adequate, or should we implement best-end-for-each-start optimization for speed? Any benefit from adding a small bias toward spans overlapping center or with token-length penalty rather than char-length? Any common gotchas on DeBERTa offset mappings (SPM, byte fallback) we should guard against during reconstruction?\\n5) Seeds/Epochs: With remaining time, would you recommend adding a second seed run for either backbone, or bumping epochs to 4 with early stopping by jaccard? Which historically yields more lift for this task given our current OOF baseline?\\n6) Final submission: For test-time PP, we plan to reuse thresholds derived from OOF score distribution. Confirm this is sound, and suggest any calibration tweak (e.g., per-sentiment thresholds).\\n\\nPlease advise on whether to allow DeBERTa to continue, the precise PP/ensemble choices most likely to secure \\u22650.7175 OOF (silver) and ideally \\u22650.7269 (gold), and any pitfalls you see in our current pipeline.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Bottom line\n- Let DeBERTa finish. With your fold OOFs, expect 0.715–0.719 OOF single-model. That’s higher ROI than interrupting to PP RoBERTa now and is needed for a strong blend.\n\nHigh-ROI PP (tune on OOF, then apply)\n- Keep: neutral → full tweet.\n- Knobs: length_penalty_per_char grid [0.0, 0.002, 0.003, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008]; low-confidence fallback by percentile (try {None, 0.02, 0.05}).\n- Tune per-sentiment PP for pos/neg (separate lp and fallback percentiles). Neutral remains full text.\n- Guards:\n  - Mask to context tokens only and ignore zero-length offsets (offsets[i][1] > offsets[i][0]).\n  - Enforce j>=i; if decoded span trims to empty after outer whitespace strip, fallback to full text.\n  - If start>end occurs in any alternative path, set end=start (or fallback to full text).\n- Optional only if time and OOF proves it: token-length penalty as an alternative to char-length; temperature scaling is usually low gain—skip unless it wins on OOF.\n- Light trimming only: strip outer whitespace; avoid aggressive punctuation rules.\n\nEnsembling (logit-level, then one decode with tuned PP)\n- Average logits across folds within each backbone.\n- Blend backbones with a single weight w tuned on OOF: try w ∈ {0.45, 0.5, 0.55} for DeBERTa share. Equal weights are fine; slight OOF-weighting may add ~+0.001.\n- Arithmetic mean of raw logits > geometric mean of softmax here. Blend logits first, then decode once.\n- If chasing last drops and time allows: per-sentiment blend weights (tiny extra).\n\nDecoding\n- Your O(N^2) i≤j search with sl[i]+el[j]−lp*char_len is correct and fast enough; no need for “best end per start” optimization.\n- No center bias; char-length penalty is preferred; token-length variant is OK only if it wins on OOF.\n- DeBERTa gotchas: SentencePiece/byte fallback can yield empty offsets—filter them; always use tokenizer’s offset_mapping and same tokenization params at decode time.\n\nSeeds/Epochs\n- Prefer a second DeBERTa-v3-base seed over adding a 4th epoch. Seed diversity typically yields +0.002–0.005; extra epochs are less reliable and risk overfit.\n\nThreshold reuse on test\n- Derive fallback percentile on the exact OOF logits you’ll deploy (after blending). Reuse the same percentile for test (i.e., compute OOF score distribution once on the blended OOF; apply that percentile’s score threshold to test). Per-sentiment percentiles for pos/neg usually add a small, safe gain.\n\nExpected trajectory (typical)\n- RoBERTa + tuned PP: ~0.710–0.715 OOF.\n- DeBERTa + tuned PP: ~0.717–0.720 OOF.\n- Two-backbone blend + tuned PP: ~0.720–0.723 (silver).\n- Add a second DeBERTa seed and reblend: low 0.72s, with a realistic shot at ~0.725–0.728 (gold-range if everything is clean).\n\nPitfalls to avoid\n- Using thresholds tuned on one model/logit scale for another—always tune on the final blended OOF.\n- Including zero-length/非-context tokens in span search.\n- Over-aggressive PP (beyond outer whitespace strip).\n- Any tokenization mismatch (params/max_len) between train and decode.\n\nAction plan\n1) Let DeBERTa finish 5 folds.\n2) Run PP sweep on RoBERTa OOF logits (add per-sentiment lp/fallback, zero-length-offset guard).\n3) Run the same PP sweep on DeBERTa OOF logits.\n4) Blend RoBERTa+DeBERTa logits; grid w ∈ {0.45, 0.5, 0.55}. For each w, decode OOF with tuned PP; re-derive fallback percentile on the blended OOF scores; pick best w.\n5) Apply those exact PP params and the OOF-derived percentile threshold to test for the blended logits; submit.\n6) Launch DeBERTa second-seed 5-fold; average logits across seeds within backbone, redo step 4–5 for a gold push.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: close the ~0.007 gap by finishing DeBERTa, adding punctuation-aware post-processing, and ensembling at the logit level; if still short, add seeds or one large model.\n\nPrioritized plan\n1) Finish and stabilize backbone\n- Do not interrupt DeBERTa-v3-base 5-fold. Target OOF ~0.712–0.715.\n- If remaining folds average <0.712 or are unstable, rerun with LR 1e-5–1.5e-5, 4–5 epochs, label smoothing 0.1, same MAX_LEN 128, gradient accumulation to keep effective batch high.\n\n2) Post-processing (must-have, tune on OOF once and reuse on test)\n- Neutral → always return full tweet.\n- Decode with O(N^2) span search on context tokens only; enforce start ≤ end.\n- Tune length_penalty per character in [0.002, 0.006] on OOF.\n- Low-confidence fallback: compute span score (best start+end − length_penalty*len); fallback to full tweet if below OOF-calibrated threshold (2–5th percentile). Optionally per-sentiment thresholds.\n- Trim leading/trailing whitespace and edge punctuation (. , ! ? ; : ' \" ) but preserve emoticons like :) :( :D. Do not strip internal spaces. Handle URLs consistently (either fully include or exclude). Never return empty.\n\n3) Ensemble (medal unlock)\n- Average start/end logits across folds and across backbones (RoBERTa-base + DeBERTa-v3-base). Weight models by their OOF Jaccard; optionally sentiment-specific weights.\n- Decode once from the blended logits using the tuned PP. Expect +0.003–0.007.\n\n4) If OOF still <0.717\n- Add diversity via seeds: train 1–2 extra seeds (DeBERTa and/or RoBERTa) and add to the ensemble (+0.002–0.004).\n- Train a single stronger backbone for 2–3 folds if time/VRAM allow:\n  - roberta-large or microsoft/deberta-v3-large; LR ~1.5e-5, 3–4 epochs, MAX_LEN 96–128, gradient accumulation (effective batch 64–128), gradient checkpointing if needed. Single-model lift +0.005–0.012.\n- Consider sentiment specialization: exclude neutral from training (keep neutral → full at inference) or train separate pos/neg models (+0.002–0.007).\n- Optional TTA: average logits over a few max_len settings (e.g., 96, 112, 128).\n\nPitfalls to avoid\n- Token/char alignment: use fast tokenizer with offsets and sequence_ids; decode on context tokens only; same tokenizer and max_len for OOF/test.\n- Keep OOF and test decode paths identical (same penalties, trimming, thresholds). Load best checkpoint per fold for inference.\n- Don’t overfit PP with ad hoc rules; pick parameters once on OOF and don’t tweak after seeing LB.\n- Guard edge cases: short tweets, URLs, emojis; never emit empty strings.\n\nActionable submission sequence\n- Step 1: Let DeBERTa finish. Save OOF/test logits.\n- Step 2: Run PP tuning on RoBERTa OOF, then mirror for DeBERTa; set length_penalty (~0.003–0.004 typical) and fallback percentile (2–5%).\n- Step 3: Produce three submissions:\n  1) DeBERTa-only + tuned PP\n  2) RoBERTa-only + same PP\n  3) Weighted RoBERTa+DeBERTa logit ensemble + same PP (primary)\n- Step 4 (if needed): Add seeds and/or a 2–3-fold large model, re-ensemble, and resubmit.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-30 16:39:29] Cell 6 in `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb` has been executing for 1307s and is still executing.

    "llm_json": "**Planning actions for DeBERTa**\n\nI need to figure out my next steps now that DeBERTa training is running. The advice suggests letting it finish before taking action. In the meantime, I can add new cells for PP sweeping and blending but can’t execute them yet. I already have PP tuning for RoBERTa in the existing cell. I should insert two new cells: one for DeBERTa's logits and another for blending RoBERTa and DeBERTa. I also need to adjust the PP for per-sentiment.**Designing a staged cell**\n\nI want to create a staged cell to load OOF logits for RoBERTa and, later, DeBERTa if they exist. I need to include checks for file existence. I should define decoding scores while ignoring zero-length offsets and always using neutral full text. \n\n Also, I should allow for per-sentiment LP and fallback percentile dictionaries. Once I have DeBERTa's OOF logits, I’ll blend them with either weights of [0.45, 0.5, 0.55] and recalculate thresholds based on sentiments. \n\nFinally, I will load test fold logits and write submission files accordingly, but for now, I’ll just append this as a new cell at index 8.**Inserting new code cell**\n\nI need to perform an edit on the file to insert a new code cell. First, I’ll craft code for reading OOF CSVs and NPIs. I have to build a function to get the tokenizer for each model and create a generic function for sequence IDs and offsets.\n\nThen, I want to implement an evaluation routine for a given pair of logits and a tokenizer that will produce predictions, scores, and OOF Jaccard statistics for per-sentiment parameters. \n\nI’ll create a per-sentiment LP dictionary and set fallback percentiles exclusively for positive and negative sentiments while keeping neutral full. During tuning, I’ll use grids for LP and fallback values to compute OOF Jaccard, keeping the best score. \n\nFinally, I’ll apply derived thresholds to the test scores and blend the logits for both models accordingly.**Tuning weights and implementing functions**\n\nThe advice I'm working with involves tuning weights \\( w \\) using OOF scores. For each weight, I need to decode the OOF with tuned PP settings and derive fallback percentiles on the blended OOF scores to find the best weight. However, I should re-tune the PP parameters on the blended OOF rather than reusing model-specific ones.\n\nSo, I’m planning to implement a function to evaluate the blend with the given weight and per-sentiment parameters. I’ll arrange tuning over a grid for weights and parameters, which might be heavy, but since the dataset has only 24k rows, it should be manageable. \n\nI’ll also add logging and save the outputs, like the best PP settings for RoBERTa and DeBERTa to specific JSON files. I’ll need to produce submission files when executed as well.\n\nI think adding one cell for helper functions and another for running tuning sequentially is the plan, but I'll remember the restriction on inserting only one cell per turn.**Inserting code cell**\n\nI see that I can only modify one cell per turn, so my best approach is to insert a new cell that contains all the necessary code. This way, I can keep everything organized and implement the planned functions efficiently. I’ll proceed to make this insertion at index 8, ensuring that everything flows smoothly from there.

However, there's an issue with tokenization mismatch, which complicates things. Blending logits across different tokenizers isn't straightforward. I should check expert suggestions for feasible options.**Exploring blending options**\n\nThe expert suggested blending the out-of-fold (OOF) logits from both models, maybe by decoding to character spans or averaging the logits. However, since there are different tokenizations, a typical method is to average the scores from character-level logits after projecting them. This character-grid scoring could be complex, and time may be tight. For now, I need to finish DeBERTa PP and then submit one of the entries. Aiming for a “WIN A MEDAL,” I expect the tuning to improve our previous score of 0.71202 to around 0.717.

This would involve selecting between models based on out-of-fold (OOF) performance by sentiment, like picking the model with the higher predicted score. \n\nI think I could implement a straightforward blend: use DeBERTa as the primary model and fallback to RoBERTa if DeBERTa’s score is low. This should help improve our results a bit!**Building a new cell for scoring**\n\nI'm planning to create a new cell that will load the averaged test logits for both models and the out-of-fold (OOF) tuned parameters. For DeBERTa, I have the saved parameters, but for RoBERTa, I noted the best value. \n\nFor test rows, I’ll decode both models using their respective parameters and get their scores. For neutral sentiment, it'll be full text. Otherwise, I’ll choose the higher score's span or default to DeBERTa unless its score is below a certain threshold, then switch to RoBERTa. I'll need to derive these thresholds using the OOF scores.**Recomputing OOF scores for model selection**\n\nI'm considering recomputing the OOF scores for both models and implementing a selection rule for each OOF row. This would involve decoding both models and deciding based on higher scores. I can use the Jaccard index to guide this selection and then apply that rule to the test set. \n\nI'll need to create a new cell specifically for this \"chooser\" process, decoding spans for each model independently. The goal is to select based on comparing scores—using DeBERTa primarily and switching to RoBERTa when its score is low. I can test various rules and leverage the tuned values for both models!**Waiting for cell completion**\n\nFor RoBERTa, I noted that the best settings are lp=0.008 with no fallback for all sentiments. However, we didn’t apply the per-sentiment approach for RoBERTa since cell 7 wasn’t set up that way. It’s alright! \n\nCell 9 is still running, and I expect it to finish soon, so I think I’ll take a brief break. Once that’s complete, I can create cell 10 to implement the OOF-level chooser and test decoding. So, I’ll set a timer for two more minutes to rest while I wait!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"sleep\",\n  \"sleep_payload\": {\n    \"sleep_duration_minutes\": 2.0\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Let Cell 9 finish DeBERTa PP tuning and writing submission_pp_deberta.csv.

We need +0.005 Jaccard to medal.\\n\\nRequest: Please advise the fastest, most reliable path to \\u22650.717 on this dataset with ~22h left, given we already have fully working 5-fold pipelines, cached OOF/test logits, and per-sentiment PP. Specific questions:\\n1) Backbone/Seeds: Should we train roberta-large and/or microsoft/deberta-v3-large 5-fold (2\\u20133 epochs) and ensemble with our existing DeBERTa-base? Or is it more efficient to train 2\\u20133 seeds of DeBERTa-v3-base and fold-average per seed, then seed-average? If large models, recommend exact hyperparams (max_len, batch size/grad_accum, epochs, lr) to finish in a few hours on A10 24GB.\\n2) Decoding/PP: What PP tweaks typically add +0.003\\u20130.006 here? Options we can implement quickly on cached logits: (a) beam search on spans (top-K start/end with triangular mask), (b) temperature scaling of start/end logits by sentiment, (c) per-sentiment dynamic length penalty by tweet length bins, (d) low-confidence fallback that returns full text or shortest confident span, (e) punctuation/whitespace boundary expansion/trim post-decode, (f) max span length cap (e.g., <= 0.8 * tweet length). Which of these moves needle reliably?\\n3) Ensembling: Beyond chooser, recommend a robust ensemble rule that works with different tokenizers without re-forwarding (we have OOF/test logits for each backbone separately). For example, per-row choose model by calibrated confidence margin or by per-sentiment model preference learned from OOF (e.g., simple meta-rule: DeBERTa for positive, RoBERTa for negative when z-score gap < threshold). Any proven rule-of-thumb for this competition?\\n4) Training tricks: Any light-weight training improvements we should add before large models (label smoothing, focal loss, better warmup, EMA, layerwise lr decay)? We currently use CE, warmup ratio 0.1, cosine, 3 epochs, fp16.\\n5) Time budget: If you had to pick one modeling push next to reach medal most reliably in <6 hours wall time, what is it?\\n\\nWe will follow your prioritized checklist and validate gains via our OOF framework before submitting.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the fastest, lowest‑risk path to ≥0.717 with your setup and time left.\n\nPriority plan (do in order)\n1) Train microsoft/deberta-v3-large 5-fold now. Then logit-average with your existing DeBERTa-v3-base, retune PP on the blended OOF, apply to test, submit.\n2) While large trains, add boundary cleaning PP to your current decode (word/punctuation boundary fix). Validate on OOF; keep only if +gain.\n3) If still short, add one more deberta-v3-base seed and within-backbone logit-average before the large+base blend.\n\nDirect answers\n\n1) Backbone/Seeds\n- Do: microsoft/deberta-v3-large 5-fold. Expect +0.005–0.010 vs current base.\n- Hyperparams (A10 24GB, fits and is fast; match base tokenization for easy blending):\n  - model: microsoft/deberta-v3-large\n  - max_len: 128\n  - epochs: 2\n  - lr: 1e-5 (safe) or 1.5e-5 (slightly faster convergence)\n  - per_device_train_batch_size: 8–12 (start with 12; if OOM drop to 8)\n  - gradient_accumulation_steps: 8 (if bs=8) or 6 (if bs=12) so effective batch ≈64\n  - weight_decay: 0.01, warmup_ratio: 0.1, lr_scheduler: cosine, fp16=True, max_grad_norm=1.0\n  - eval/save each epoch, load_best_model_at_end=True\n- Skip roberta-large. If time remains after v3-large, add a second v3-base seed (cheap +0.001–0.003).\n- Seed-only push (without large) is less reliable than v3-large for +0.005 in your time.\n\n2) Decoding/PP (quick wins on cached logits)\n- Keep: per-sentiment length penalty (you already tuned pos=0.008, neg=0.002).\n- Add: boundary cleaning\n  - After span decode, expand to full word boundaries and trim outer whitespace/punctuation (.,!?; quotes) only if OOF improves. This is typically +0.001–0.003.\n- Optional: low-confidence fallback only if OOF thresholding clearly helps (your grid showed it didn’t; default to off).\n- Skip: beam search, temperature scaling, tweet-length-bin penalties, hard max-span caps.\n\n3) Ensembling (no re-forwarding across tokenizers)\n- Robust: logit-average within the same tokenizer only.\n  - After v3-large 5-fold, average its folds to get OOF/test logits.\n  - Blend with your v3-base averaged logits: start_blend = w*start_large + (1-w)*start_base (same for end).\n  - Grid w ∈ {0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8} on OOF; pick best. Expect weight to favor large (≈0.6–0.8).\n  - Decode once with your tuned PP + boundary cleaning.\n- Avoid chooser/meta across different tokenizers (you already saw the drop).\n\n4) Training tricks (only if trivial)\n- EMA (decay ~0.999) can add ~+0.001–0.002 if you have a ready util.\n- Label smoothing/LLRD/focal: skip for this sprint unless pre-wired. Your current CE + warmup 0.1 + cosine + fp16 is fine.\n\n5) One <6h push to medal\n- Train DeBERTa‑v3‑large 5-fold (params above), blend its logits with your DeBERTa‑v3‑base, retune PP on blended OOF (same per‑sentiment lp + boundary cleaning), apply to test, submit.\n\nConcrete checklist\n- Start v3-large 5-fold now (epochs=2, max_len=128, bs=12 ga=6 or bs=8 ga=8).\n- While training:\n  - Implement boundary cleaning: if decoded span starts/ends mid-word, expand to nearest whitespace; then strip outer punctuation/extra spaces. Validate on current base OOF; keep only if +OOF.\n- When v3-large finishes:\n  - Cache OOF/test logits; OOF-blend with base over w grid; pick best w by OOF.\n  - Retune per-sentiment length_penalty on blended OOF (small grid around your current best).\n  - Apply best PP (lp + boundary cleaning) to blended test logits; write submission.\n- If still <0.717 and time left: train one more v3-base seed, within-backbone average, then re-run the large+base blend and PP.\n\nKey guardrails\n- Keep max_len consistent (128) between base and large for clean logit blending.\n- Reuse exact tokenizer/settings at inference as during training.\n- Validate every tweak on OOF; ship only proven gains.\n\nThis path minimizes risk and should push you ≥0.717.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: prioritize seed ensembling and 1 larger backbone, then apply small, safe PP gains. Drop the chooser.\n\nPriority actions (fastest gains)\n- Train 2–3 more seeds of DeBERTa-v3-base (same 5-fold pipeline; e.g., seeds 43/44/45). Average start/end logits across folds and seeds, then decode. Typical +0.001–0.003.\n- If still <0.717, train one 5-fold DeBERTa-v3-large (preferred) or roberta-large:\n  - Settings: max_len 128, 4–5 epochs, lr 2e-5–3e-5, warmup 0.1, fp16, gradient accumulation (e.g., 2–4), early stopping (patience 1–2), load_best_model_at_end=True.\n  - If memory tight, use gradient checkpointing. Average logits across folds (and seeds if you run 2 seeds).\n  - Expect +0.002–0.006 vs base.\n\nDecoding and post-processing (small, safe bumps)\n- Keep neutral → full tweet.\n- Per-sentiment length_penalty: start from pos=0.008, neg=0.002 (your best) and sweep 0.000–0.012 in 0.001 steps.\n- Low-confidence fallback: tiny per-sent percentiles (e.g., 0.005–0.02) derived from OOF span-score distribution.\n- Edge cleanup: after offset reconstruction, strip whitespace and symmetric edge punctuation/quotes only if attached to boundaries (e.g., leading ' \" ( [ { and trailing ) ] } , . ! ? ; :).\n- Decode with the same tokenizer used to produce logits; do not cross-tokenizer blend.\n\nTraining refinements (apply if low overhead)\n- Label smoothing ~0.05, LLRD, no weight decay on LayerNorm/bias.\n- 5-fold stratified by sentiment (you already do), max_len 128, mixed precision.\n- Mild pos/neg oversampling to reduce long-span bias.\n- Cache logits and OOF artifacts; keep current best submission as fallback.\n\nEnsembling rules\n- Only average logits within the same backbone/tokenizer across folds and seeds.\n- Model soup within same backbone is optional.\n- Do not use the “chooser” (it underperformed). Avoid cross-tokenizer logit averaging; if you add a different backbone, use it as a standalone model or a carefully validated text-level pick (only if it beats your single-Backbone ensemble OOF).\n\nOptional (time-permitting)\n- Pseudo-labeling with high-confidence test spans, then a short retrain.\n- Light TTA (minor input variants) averaged at decode, if neutral on OOF speed/accuracy.\n\nExecution order (with time targets)\n1) Multi-seed DeBERTa-v3-base (2–3 seeds), logit-average, retune PP grid (2–4 h), submit.\n2) If needed, train DeBERTa-v3-large 5-fold (4–6 h), logit-average, retune PP, submit.\n3) Apply small PP refinements (length_penalty micro-sweeps, tiny fallbacks, edge trimming) to whichever model/ensemble is strongest on OOF; monitor LB."
