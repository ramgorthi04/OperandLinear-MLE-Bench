Seeking guidance before coding. Key decisions to optimize for ROC-AUC and medal: 1) Best text preprocessing for this dataset (URLs/mentions/numbers normalization, punctuation handling, casing, stemming/lemmatization: usually none for char-ngrams). 2) Vectorization choices: a) Word TF-IDF ngrams (1,2) vs (1,3); stop_words='english' or not; min_df (1/2/3); max_features scale. b) Char TF-IDF ngram ranges: (3,5) vs (3,6) vs (2,5); analyzer='char_wb' or 'char'; recommended min_df. 3) Model choice: LogisticRegression(saga) vs SGDClassifier(log) vs LinearSVC + calibration for best AUC on this dataset; typical C/alpha ranges. 4) CV design: 5-fold StratifiedKFold seems standard; any leakage concerns or better splits? 5) Ensembling: Is a simple average of word-only and char-only logistic models beneficial here?

    "outcome": "**Quick Path to ≥0.82 AUC (Silver Medal)**\n1.  **Preprocessing:** Lowercase text, strip unicode accents, and replace URLs/mentions/numbers with special tokens (`<url>`, `<user>`, `<num>`). Keep all punctuation and emoticons.\n2.  **Modeling:** Create two separate `LogisticRegression` models within a `Pipeline` to prevent data leakage.\n    *   **Model W (Word):** `TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), stop_words=None, min_df=2, sublinear_tf=True, max_features=100000)`\n    *   **Model C (Char):** `TfidfVectorizer(analyzer='char', ngram_range=(3,5), min_df=2, sublinear_tf=True, max_features=200000)`\n3.  **CV & Ensembling:** Use 5-fold `StratifiedKFold`. Get out-of-fold (OOF) predictions from both models. Find the optimal weight `w` that maximizes AUC for the blend `w * oof_char + (1-w) * oof_word`. The weight for the char model will likely be 0.6-0.7. This is the single most important step for score improvement.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Synthesis**\n\n**1. Preprocessing**\n*   **Casing:** Use `lowercase=True`. Before lowercasing, create a meta-feature for `fraction_of_caps` to capture emphasis.\n*   **Normalization:** Replace URLs, user mentions, and numbers with dedicated tokens (e.g., `<url>`, `<user>`, `<num>`).\n*   **Punctuation & Emojis:** Keep them. They are critical signals for char n-grams.\n*   **Accents:** Use `strip_accents='unicode'`.\n*   **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Do not use. It harms performance by degrading char n-gram signals.\n\n**2. Vectorization (TF-IDF)**\n*   **General Parameters:** Use `sublinear_tf=True` and `norm='l2'` for both vectorizers.\n*   **Word TF-IDF:**\n    *   **N-grams:** `(1,2)` is the consensus. `(1,3)` can add noise.\n    *   **Stopwords:** `stop_words=None`. Insults and key phrases are often in default stopword lists.\n    *   **`min_df`:** `2`. Avoid `3` or higher to prevent pruning rare but important slurs.\n    *   **`max_features`:** Start with 50k-100k.\n*   **Char TF-IDF (Most Important Component):**\n    *   **N-grams:** `(3,5)` is a strong default. `(3,6)` is a good alternative to test.\n    *   **Analyzer:** Start with `analyzer='char'`. It captures cross-word patterns (e.g., \"you idiot\") which is effective for insults. `analyzer='char_wb'` (word boundary) is a strong alternative to test but may perform slightly worse.\n    *   **`min_df`:** `2`.\n    *   **`max_features`:** Start with 150k-250k.\n\n**3. Model**\n*   **Primary Choice:** `LogisticRegression`. It is fast, stable, and produces probabilities needed for AUC.\n    *   **Solver:** `saga` is recommended for speed with large sparse features. `liblinear` is a robust alternative.\n    *   **Regularization:** `penalty='l2'`. Start with `C=1.0` or `C=2.0` and tune from `[0.5, 1, 2, 4]`.\n*   **Alternative:** `LinearSVC` with `CalibratedClassifierCV` is a good second model for ensembling but adds overhead. `SGDClassifier(loss='log_loss')` is a very fast alternative that can match LR performance.\n\n**4. Cross-Validation and Ensembling**\n*   **CV Strategy:** Use `StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)`.\n*   **Leakage Prevention:** **Crucially, fit vectorizers inside each fold.** The best practice is to wrap the vectorizer and model in an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`.\n*   **Ensembling:**\n    1.  Train separate word-only and char-only models.\n    2.  Use `cross_val_predict` to get OOF probabilities for each.\n    3.  Find the optimal blend weight `w` on OOF predictions to maximize AUC.\n    4.  Apply this weight to the test set predictions from models retrained on the full dataset.\n\n**5. Feature Engineering (for an extra ~0.005 AUC)**\n*   Add simple meta-features and combine them with your TF-IDF matrix using `scipy.sparse.hstack`.\n    *   `comment_length` (char and word count)\n    *   `fraction_of_caps` (calculated before lowercasing)\n    *   Count of specific punctuation (e.g., `!`, `?`)\n*   Avoid external slur lexicons; they are brittle. Let the char n-grams learn these patterns robustly from the data.\n\n**6. Runtime and Memory**\n*   Use sparse matrices throughout. Never call `.toarray()`.\n*   With the specified resources, memory is not a concern. A combined feature count of 300k-500k is feasible.\n*   `scipy.sparse.hstack` is more memory-efficient than `FeatureUnion` for combining feature matrices.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Execute now. The plan is solid, but there’s no code, CV score, or submission. Build a fast TF-IDF + linear baseline with proper CV, then iterate.\n\nWhat to do in order:\n- Load data and inspect:\n  - train.csv/test.csv; text column likely “Comment”, target “Insult”.\n  - Check class balance; use StratifiedKFold (5–10 folds), roc_auc scoring.\n- Baseline (should hit ≥0.79 AUC quickly):\n  - Vectorizers:\n    - Word TF-IDF: analyzer=word, ngram_range=(1,2), min_df=2, sublinear_tf=True, lowercase, strip_accents='unicode', optional stop_words='english'.\n    - Char TF-IDF: analyzer=char_wb, ngram_range=(3,5) (try (3,6) if needed), min_df=2, sublinear_tf=True.\n    - Combine with FeatureUnion or hstack.\n  - Model: LogisticRegression(solver='saga', penalty='l2', C∈{0.5,1,2,4}, max_iter≥1000). Use class_weight='balanced' if skewed.\n  - CV target: mean AUC ≥0.80 preferred; ≥0.79 acceptable for bronze path.\n- Submission:\n  - Fit on full train, predict test probabilities, save submission.csv with columns: id, Insult.\n\nIf CV AUC <0.79:\n- Feature tweaks:\n  - Expand n-grams: word (1,3); char (3,6).\n  - Lower min_df to 1 if data is small; don’t raise >3.\n  - Ensure sublinear_tf=True; keep punctuation; lowercase; strip accents.\n- Light preprocessing:\n  - Replace URLs/mentions/numbers with tokens (URL, @USER, NUM); de-emojify if present. Avoid heavy stemming; char n-grams handle variants.\n- Model/tuning:\n  - Sweep C: {0.1,0.5,1,2,5}. Try SGDClassifier(loss='log_loss', alpha∈[1e-5,1e-4]) for speed.\n  - Try Calibrated LinearSVC and average probs with logistic.\n\nPushing medals:\n- Bronze (≥0.79111): Word+char TF-IDF + logistic should suffice; char n-grams are crucial.\n- Silver (≥0.82307): Tune C/ngram ranges/min_df; add ensemble:\n  - Blend word-only and char-only logistic; optionally add calibrated LinearSVC; simple average of probabilities (+0.01–0.03 AUC typical).\n- Gold (≥0.83321): Add small auxiliary features (e.g., length, simple sentiment) or a light second-stage model (e.g., XGBoost) on out-of-fold predictions; keep overfitting in check.\n\nPitfalls to avoid:\n- No submission/no CV: produce both early.\n- Data leakage: fit vectorizers inside CV or fit on train folds only for OOF; for quick iteration, measure with cross_val_score on a pipeline.\n- Overfitting on tiny data: prefer linear models, more folds (10), minimal tuning.\n- Efficiency: use sparse matrices; if slow, switch to SGD.\n\nTime plan (≈2 hours):\n- 0–30 min: load data, build baseline word+char TF-IDF + logistic, 5-fold CV.\n- 30–60 min: tune C/ngrams/min_df; add class_weight if skewed.\n- 60–90 min: ensemble (word vs char; +calibrated LinearSVC).\n- 90–120 min: train on full data; generate submission.csv.\n\nDeliverables checklist:\n- Printed CV AUC (mean±std) meeting targets.\n- submission.csv with id, Insult.\n- Notes on best config (ngrams, min_df, C) and any ensemble used."
