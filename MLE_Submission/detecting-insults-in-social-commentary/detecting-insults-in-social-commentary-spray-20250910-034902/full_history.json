    "llm_json": "**Planning data workflow**\n\nI need to start by creating a notebook with a clear plan, including steps for exploratory data analysis (EDA), loading data, and building a baseline model. According to the workflow, I should request expert review at major checkpoints, especially after establishing the plan. I’ll first set up a markdown cell to outline the plan and steps, followed by code for imports and initial setup, like loading data and creating a baseline model. I'll mention efficient techniques like TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.**Preparing to analyze dataset**\n\nI need to check the dataset for detecting insults. It usually includes columns like Comment, Insult (0/1), and possibly Date. I'll start by planning to load train.csv, but hold off on executing the code just yet. I'm thinking I should add logging first to help track things. Even though training with Logistic Regression and TF-IDF isn't heavy, I’ll still request expert review after completing the plan. For now, I'll set up the code to read CSVs, analyze counts, and define a text preprocessor with normalization steps. I’ll also consider using TfidfVectorizer with various n-grams and setting up a Logistic Regression model.**Setting up submission process**\n\nI realize AUC isn’t needed right now. I need to set up a StratifiedKFold cross-validation with 5 folds, shuffle the data, and log the time taken for predictions. The plan is to fit the model on the full training data and then predict for the test set, aiming to create a submission.csv with Id and Insult columns. Since I can't access files directly now, I’ll assume the test set has an \"id\" column. In the Kaggle competition, it typically includes \"Id,\" \"Comment,\" and \"Insult.\" I'll handle this robustly in the code and get ready to insert multiple cells in the notebook.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 0,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Plan to Medal: Detecting Insults in Social Commentary\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Goal: Optimize AUC-ROC with robust text modeling under time limits.\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Milestones:\",\n      \"- Data loading & sanity checks (schema, target balance)\",\n      \"- Baseline: TF-IDF (word + char) + Logistic Regression with 5-fold Stratified CV\",\n      \"- Iterate: tune n-grams, min_df, C, optional class weights\",\n      \"- Add simple preprocessing (lowercase, URL/user/number normalization)\",\n      \"- Error analysis: top coefficients, misclassified examples\",\n      \"- Finalize and generate submission.csv\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Checkpoints for Expert Review:\",\n      \"- After plan (this cell)\",\n      \"- After initial EDA\",\n      \"- After baseline CV results\",\n      \"- After tuning trials (if needed)\",\n      \"- Before final submission\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Time Management:\",\n      \"- Baseline within ~15 minutes\",\n      \"- Iterative tuning in parallel with light EDA\",\n      \"- Log timing per fold; interrupt if slow\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"markdown\"\n  }\n}",

    "outcome": "**Overall Assessment**\nThe plan is solid and follows a classic, medal-winning structure for text classification. The baseline is strong, and the proposed improvements are well-chosen. The key to success will be disciplined execution, prioritizing high-ROI tasks, and avoiding common pitfalls like over-cleaning the text.\n\n**1. Immediate Actions & Data Validation**\n*   **Column Verification:** Your first step must be to load the data and verify all column names using `train.columns`, `test.columns`, and the `sample_submission_null.csv`. Pay close attention to capitalization (`Id` vs. `id`). The entire pipeline depends on this.\n*   **Class Balance:** Check the distribution of the 'Insult' target. The dataset is likely imbalanced, making this a critical check.\n*   **Duplicates:** Check for exact duplicate comments within the training data and between the train and test sets.\n\n**2. Baseline Model & Performance**\n*   The proposed baseline (TF-IDF with word(1,2) and char(3,5) n-grams + Logistic Regression) is excellent.\n*   Expect an initial score of **~0.81-0.82 AUC**. With proper tuning and the improvements below, this approach has a clear path to **0.83+ AUC**.\n\n**3. Priority Improvements (in order of impact vs. effort)**\n1.  **Class Weights:** Immediately add `class_weight='balanced'` to your linear models. This is a one-line change that directly addresses class imbalance.\n2.  **NB-SVM:** This is the highest-impact improvement. Implementing a Naive Bayes-SVM (using log-count ratios as features for a linear model) frequently boosts AUC by **+0.01-0.02**.\n3.  **SGDClassifier:** Use for rapid iteration and hyperparameter sweeps, as its `early_stopping` feature saves significant time.\n4.  **LinearSVC:** Lower priority. Performance is often marginal compared to a well-tuned Logistic Regression.\n\n**4. Preprocessing Strategy**\n*   **Minimal Cleaning is Critical:** **Do not** remove punctuation, stop words, or emojis. These are strong predictive features for insults and will be captured by character n-grams.\n*   **Normalization:** Normalize URLs, user mentions, and numbers to special tokens (e.g., `_URL_`, `_USER_`, `_NUM_`). Use `html.unescape` if you see HTML entities.\n*   **Casing:** Start with `lowercase=True` in your `TfidfVectorizer`. This is a safe and effective default for word-based models.\n\n**5. Tuning & Parameters**\n*   **Model `C`:** Use a logarithmic grid, e.g., `[0.1, 1, 10, 100]`.\n*   **TF-IDF `min_df`:** Start with `2` or `3` to filter out rare typos and noise.\n*   **TF-IDF `char_ngram_range`:** `(3, 5)` is a strong start. Also test a wider range like `(2, 6)`.\n*   **Memory Management:** Use `max_features` (e.g., `30k-50k` for words, `50k-100k+` for chars) if you encounter memory issues.\n\n**6. Cross-Validation (CV)**\n*   Use `StratifiedKFold` with `n_splits=5`, `shuffle=True`, and a fixed `random_state` for robust and reproducible results.\n*   **Prevent Leakage:** Crucially, fit your vectorizers (`TfidfVectorizer`) *inside* each CV fold, not on the full training data before splitting.\n*   If you find many duplicate comments, consider using `GroupKFold` to ensure duplicates do not span across train/validation splits, which would inflate CV scores.\n\n**7. Ensembling**\n*   **Do not use stacking.** It is too complex and time-consuming.\n*   A **simple average** of predictions from 2-4 diverse models (e.g., Word-LR, Char-LR, Word-NB-SVM, Char-NB-SVM) is the most reliable path to a top score.\n*   **Pro-Tip:** For better robustness, average the **ranks** of the predictions (`scipy.stats.rankdata`) instead of the raw probabilities.\n\n**8. Key Pitfalls & Final Advice**\n*   **Calibration:** **Skip it.** It does not improve AUC and is a waste of time.\n*   **Biggest Pitfall:** Over-cleaning the text. The stylistic features captured by character n-grams (punctuation, casing, repeated letters) are as important as the words themselves.\n*   **Strongest Approach:** A rank-averaged ensemble of a word-based model and a character-based model (especially with an NB-SVM variant included) is a proven gold-medal strategy for this type of problem.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Get a fast, strong TF‑IDF + linear baseline with robust CV today; target ≥0.79 OOF AUC before submitting. Iterate with char n‑grams and calibrated linear models; add small, high-signal features. Submit clean probabilities [id, Insult].\n\nStatus and targets\n- Not on track: no code, no submission.\n- Targets (AUC‑ROC): bronze ≥0.79111; silver ≥0.82307; gold ≥0.83321.\n\nImmediate actions (today)\n- Load data; fillna(\"\"), ensure UTF‑8, strip control chars. Verify target is 0/1 and check class balance.\n- Build a single sklearn Pipeline; all preprocessing inside to avoid leakage.\n- 5‑fold StratifiedKFold; compute out‑of‑fold (OOF) AUC as your gate.\n- Train baseline and get OOF AUC. If ≥0.79, fit on full train, predict_proba on test, save submission.csv with [id, Insult].\n- Make at least 3 submissions: baseline, tuned, final.\n\nBaseline pipeline (15–20 minutes)\n- Features (FeatureUnion):\n  - Word TF‑IDF: ngram_range=(1,2) or (1,3); min_df=2–5; sublinear_tf=True; lowercase=True; stop_words=None (keep stopwords).\n  - Char TF‑IDF: ngram_range=(3,5) (optionally test 3–6); analyzer=\"char\" or \"char_wb\"; min_df=2–5; sublinear_tf=True.\n- Light normalization: replace URLs/mentions/numbers with tokens; keep punctuation/emoticons; don’t over-clean.\n- Model: LogisticRegression (saga/liblinear), C∈{1,2,3,5}; max_iter=2000; class_weight=\"balanced\" if minority <35–40%.\n- Metric: OOF roc_auc_score from predict_proba[:,1].\n\nFast iterations (pick by OOF AUC)\n- Tune n‑grams (word 1–2 vs 1–3; char 3–5 vs 3–6), min_df (2 vs 5), C (2–6). Consider max_features cap if RAM needed.\n- Try LinearSVC + CalibratedClassifierCV (cv=3, sigmoid); use decision_function after calibration.\n- Try NB‑SVM (log‑count ratio) on word n‑grams; often +0.01–0.02 AUC.\n- Small boosts: add sparse features (length, exclamation count, caps ratio, profanity lexicon counts, elongated token count). Concatenate to sparse matrix.\n\nPreprocessing do/don’t (insult-specific)\n- Do: include char n‑grams (catch l33t/obfuscation), keep punctuation and stopwords, preserve signal from capitalization via caps‑ratio feature.\n- Don’t: aggressively lowercase/remove punctuation/strip repeats; avoid heavy stemming/lemmatization.\n\nGotchas and safeguards\n- Leakage: fit vectorizers and calibrators only on training folds; don’t merge train+test during CV.\n- AUC needs calibrated scores: use predict_proba or calibrated decision_function; don’t threshold for scoring.\n- Imbalance: use stratified CV; try class_weight but verify via CV.\n- Small data: CV can overestimate; if possible, validate with a small holdout; seed all RNGs.\n- Performance/compute: use sparse matrices, min_df/max_features to control size; avoid dense embeddings.\n- Submission: exact columns [id, Insult]; Insult must be probability [0,1]; index=False.\n\nPath to silver/gold\n- Ensemble calibrated LinearSVC + LR (+ NB‑SVM) via weighted average.\n- Try LightGBM/XGBoost on TF‑IDF features.\n- Refine char n‑grams and feature union; add a few high-signal handcrafted features.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Build TF‑IDF(word 1–2/1–3 + char 3–5) → LR(C≈2–5), 5‑fold stratified OOF AUC today.\n- If OOF ≥0.79: train on full data, submit probabilities. If 0.76–0.79: add/strengthen char n‑grams and tune C/min_df; try NB‑SVM or calibrated LinearSVC. If <0.76: recheck preprocessing, leakage, and class_weight.\n- Keep everything in a Pipeline; avoid over‑cleaning; submit [id, Insult] probabilities."
