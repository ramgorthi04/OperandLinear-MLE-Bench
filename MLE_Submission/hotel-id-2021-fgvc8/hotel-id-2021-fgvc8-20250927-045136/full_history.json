I’ll run `nvidia-smi` using subprocess to check the GPU, then list counts of image files in the `test_images` directory, which appears to have 0 directories but 9756 direct files.\n\nFor `train_images`, I’ll iterate through subdirectories to count image files. I’ll read `train.csv` to check its shape, columns, and unique counts focusing on `hotel_id` and `image`. Then, I’ll read the `sample_submission.csv` head.\n\nI’ll also validate that the image files exist under `train_images` by checking paths like `train_images/{hotel_id}/{image}.jpg`.

There are 87,797 images spread across the \"train_images\" subdirectories, yet it says 0 files? It seems the data is organized by chains—a possible path being \"train_images/<chain>/<image>.\" I need to test this. For the model, while a CNN classifier could work for predicting hotel IDs, maybe starting with kNN on extracted embeddings from models like timm or torchvision would be simpler, especially since pre-trained options aren't installed yet.**Planning the kNN approach**\n\nFor tackling this task, my baseline plan involves using a pre-trained ImageNet model to extract features for both train and test images, and then employing kNN to predict the top-5 hotel IDs. This should be quick and doesn’t require additional training. I need to fix the path mapping first and implement a feature extractor using timm or torchvision's ResNet50. Next, I’ll build a dataloader for image processing, extract features, and compute cosine similarity to find the closest matches among the training data. Finally, I’ll ensure we get an expert review after auditing the data.**Requesting expert review**\n\nI’m preparing to request an expert review, and I need to share my notebook to get feedback on a few key points. First, I want to confirm the path structure for images and whether the chain is used solely as a directory. Additionally, I need recommendations for a baseline kNN using ImageNet embeddings and insights on potential pitfalls, especially regarding leakage. I’m considering creating a small split for validation and want expert opinions on the choice of models and techniques for this inference-only baseline.

Which backbone/resolution/augment pipeline is best ROI for embeddings? 3) Validation: What CV protocol mirrors the public LB best here? StratifiedKFold by hotel_id? Any group leakage considerations (e.g., near-duplicates across time or chains)? 4) Inference strategy: For kNN voting, better to use cosine similarity with normalization and sum top-N per hotel_id, or use softmax over similarities?

Please advise on the quickest path to a medal for this setup.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a distilled, high‑ROI plan synthesizing all four audits to get you to a medal fast.\n\nAnswers to your questions + action plan:\n\n1) Canonical train image paths and quirks\n- Paths: train_images/<chain>/<image>. The 88 subdirs are chains; hotel_id is only a label.\n- No nested dirs under chains. Expect 1–2 missing/corrupt files; skip with try/except.\n- Fix your resolver to use chain. Add a file_path column and drop NAs.\n\n2) Fast, strong baseline (embeddings + kNN)\n- Yes—this is the quickest route to bronze/silver.\n- Backbones (best ROI):\n  - convnext_tiny (timm) at 384\n  - tf_efficientnet_b3(_ns) at ~380\n  - Optional later: add a second model (e.g., efficientnet_b3) and blend per-hotel scores.\n- Pooling + norm: global avg (or GeM if available) then L2-normalize.\n- Aug for feature extraction: just resize+center crop and ImageNet norm; no heavy augs.\n- TTA: horizontal flip; average embeddings.\n- Use FAISS IndexFlatIP (cosine via L2-normalized vectors) for speed/quality.\n- Optional quick boost: train a linear classifier (e.g., LogisticRegression on frozen features) and blend with kNN per-hotel scores; cheap + often +0.05–0.1 MAP@5.\n\n3) Validation protocol (to mirror LB)\n- Use retrieval-style CV:\n  - Split by samples (e.g., 5 folds stratified by hotel_id if possible).\n  - For each fold: build index (gallery) on train-fold embeddings; evaluate queries from val-fold against that index.\n  - Exclude the exact same image from its own neighbors when validating.\n  - Compute MAP@5 after aggregating to hotel_id (see #4).\n- If CV overestimates or you detect temporal clusters, add a small time-aware grouping (e.g., bin timestamps and use StratifiedGroupKFold), but default above usually tracks LB well.\n\n4) Inference/aggregation for kNN\n- Similarity: cosine (inner product on L2-normalized embeddings).\n- Retrieve k = 50–100 neighbors per query.\n- Aggregate per hotel_id by summing similarity weights; simple sum works well. A slight exponent (sim^p, p≈1.5–2) can help; avoid softmax.\n- Take top-5 hotels by aggregated score.\n- TTA: average embeddings first, then search.\n\n5) If training a classifier\n- Stronger than pure kNN if done right; use metric learning:\n  - Loss: ArcFace/CosFace (subcenter ArcFace if you have it).\n  - Models: convnext_tiny/small, tf_efficientnet_b3/b4, or convnext_base for a push.\n  - Image size: 384–448.\n  - Augs: light (RRC 0.8–1.0, hflip, mild color jitter). Avoid heavy geometric/blur.\n  - Opt: AdamW, cosine schedule, wd≈0.05, label smoothing 0.05–0.1. 10–20 epochs with AMP.\n  - Balanced sampler helps long tail. Mixup/CutMix very light or off for ID tasks.\n\n6) Common pitfalls\n- Wrong paths (use chain). Skip missing files.\n- Not L2-normalizing before cosine.\n- CV leakage: don’t include the query itself in the neighbor index; evaluate retrieval properly.\n- Over-augmenting hurts identifiability.\n- Class imbalance: for classifier, use balanced sampler/smoothing; for kNN, it’s less critical.\n- Ensure exactly 5 predictions per test image; map neighbor images to hotel_id.\n\nFastest path to a medal (do this next)\n- Fix paths: file_path = f\"train_images/{chain}/{image}\"; drop missing.\n- Extract embeddings:\n  - timm convnext_tiny at 384, avg/GeM pool, L2 norm, FP16, batch as large as fits. Cache train/test embeddings.\n  - TTA: original + hflip; average.\n- Build FAISS IndexFlatIP on train embeddings; query test; k=50–100; aggregate per-hotel by sum(sim^p). Output top-5.\n- Validate with retrieval CV as above; report OOF MAP@5. Submit early.\n- If CV < ~0.30, add:\n  - Second backbone and blend per-hotel scores; and/or\n  - Quick linear head on cached embeddings; blend with kNN.\n- If aiming higher, fine-tune with ArcFace at 384–448 and blend with kNN.\n\nThis route typically yields bronze quickly and can hit silver with a solid backbone, 384 res, L2+cosine, k=100, hflip TTA, and good aggregation.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: fix data access, then ship a no-train CLIP kNN retrieval baseline; fine-tune with metric learning only if needed.\n\n1) Unblocker: make every image resolvable\n- Build a robust filename→full_path index via os.walk over train_images (sharded into ~88 subdirs). Verify 100% of train.csv[\"image\"] and test files exist in the index. Handle .jpg/.jpeg/.png.\n- Likely layout: train_images/<chain>/.../image.jpg. Don’t assume flat or hotel_id folders.\n- When loading, apply EXIF orientation (PIL ImageOps.exif_transpose).\n- Re-run audit until coverage is 100% (train count should match 87,798 minus any documented missing files).\n\n2) Fastest path to bronze (primary plan; best ideas from OpenAI + Claude)\n- Model: no training. Use OpenCLIP ViT-B/32 (or ViT-L/14 if available). Fallback: torchvision resnet50 or efficientnet_b3.\n- Embeddings:\n  - Preprocess to 224–336, center crop/resize; AMP; batch inference; cache .npy.\n  - Compute train and test embeddings; L2-normalize; optional TTA = original + hflip and average.\n- Retrieval:\n  - FAISS IndexFlatIP on normalized train embeddings (GPU if available). Query with test embeddings, topK=100.\n  - Aggregate per-hotel scores: group neighbors by hotel_id, sum or softmax-weight similarities; take top-5 unique hotel_ids per test image.\n- Submission hygiene: exactly 5 space-separated ints per row, ordered by confidence, in sample_submission’s image order.\n- Expected: MAP@5 > 0.02 with CLIP on this dataset size.\n\n3) Validation and safeguards (key Grok insights)\n- CV: StratifiedKFold by hotel_id with chain as a group to prevent leakage. Track MAP@5 on OOF; avoid overfitting to LB.\n- Augmentations matter mainly when training; for inference-only baseline, keep deterministic preprocessing.\n- Sanity checks: no duplicate ids in top-5; cosine/IP similarity only after L2-normalization; chunk queries to avoid OOM.\n\n4) If baseline < 0.02, upgrade retrieval before training\n- Stronger features: switch to OpenCLIP ViT-L/14, larger resize (384), GeM pooling if backbone supports it.\n- Retrieval refinements: multi-crop/scale and average; DBA (average each train emb with its nearest neighbors); QE (average query with its top-K).\n- Re-ranking: k-reciprocal re-ranking on neighbor sets.\n- Scoring: per-hotel top-M neighbor aggregation (e.g., M=3–5) generally beats naive averaging.\n\n5) Push toward silver (Claude + OpenAI metric learning plan)\n- Fine-tune embeddings with metric losses:\n  - Backbone: convnext_base / efficientnet_v2_m / ViT-B/16 via timm; head: ArcFace or CosFace; pooling: GeM; embedding_dim ≥ 512; L2-normalize.\n  - Sampler: class-balanced or PK sampler; losses: ArcFace (margin softmax), optionally Triplet/Proxy-NCA; hard-negative mining or cross-batch memory.\n  - Optim: AdamW, cosine schedule with warmup, FP16, EMA.\n  - Aug: random resized crop, hflip, color jitter, perspective/affine, motion blur, coarse dropout; avoid MixUp/CutMix for metric losses.\n- Inference: extract fine-tuned embeddings; FAISS; apply DBA/QE + re-ranking; optional ensemble of backbones/seeds.\n- Optional hybrid: blend classifier logits with retrieval scores; or predict chain and reweight hotel candidates.\n\n6) Common pitfalls to avoid\n- Path bugs and extension mismatches; test/train order mismatch in submission; missing EXIF correction.\n- Treating this as plain classification; skipping L2-normalization; using L2 distance instead of cosine/IP.\n- CV leakage across chains; duplicates in top-5; weak augs if you fine-tune; MixUp/CutMix with metric losses.\n\nActionable sequence\n- Today AM: fix path indexing + EXIF; verify 100% coverage.\n- Today PM: CLIP no-train kNN with per-hotel aggregation + TTA; submit (target >0.02).\n- Next: add multi-scale, DBA/QE, re-ranking; resubmit.\n- If still short or aiming higher: fine-tune ArcFace+GeM with balanced sampling; index with FAISS; blend if helpful."
