However, the images/ folders show many shard subdirs but 0 files listed at the top level, suggesting images may be missing or deeply nested/unpacked differently. Before installing PyTorch and building an image pipeline, I need guidance: 1) Does this MLE-Benchmark setup include actual image files or precomputed embeddings/logits elsewhere in the repo? If images are absent by design, what artifacts should we use to train/infer (e.g., provided features, urls, or npy files)? 2) Recommended medal path here given time: which backbones/resolutions worked best historically on Herbarium 2021 with long-tail (e.g., convnext_tiny/base at 384-448)? 3) Best long-tail strategy under time: class-balanced sampling vs LDAM-DRW vs focal, and whether to use per-class reweighting or logit adjustment at inference. 4) CV protocol: stratified KFold by species_id is planned\\u2014any pitfalls (e.g., leakage by institution or specimen)? 5) If images exist but are nested, what is the expected path structure from metadata.json to actual files?

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a consolidated, no-fluff coach note to unblock you and set a medal path.\n\nAnswers to your 5 questions\n1) Data artifacts\n- Images are present, sharded under train/images/<shard>/ and test/images/<shard>/. Use metadata['images'][i]['file_name'] as the relative path under images/.\n- No precomputed embeddings/logits/URLs are provided. Train from raw images.\n\n2) Backbones/resolution that worked\n- Go straight to ConvNeXt-Base (fb_in22k_ft_in1k) at 384–448. EfficientNetV2-M (or S) at 384–448 is a strong second model.\n- Tiny/224 baselines are only for smoke tests; they won’t medal in macro-F1.\n\n3) Long-tail strategy (fast, effective)\n- Use class-balanced exposure during training:\n  - Either WeightedRandomSampler with weights ~ 1/sqrt(freq) or “effective number” class weights.\n- Loss: start with CrossEntropy + label smoothing (0.05–0.1). If needed, Focal (gamma 1.5–2.0) pairs well with balanced sampling.\n- Inference: logit adjustment by priors (logit_c -= tau*log(freq_c), tau≈1–2 tuned on OOF). Cheap and helps macro-F1.\n- TTA: 2–8 views (at least original + hflip). Save/average logits.\n\n4) CV protocol pitfalls\n- Stratified by species_id is fine; save folds and keep deterministic.\n- Prefer StratifiedGroupKFold with group=institution if available to reduce leakage; at minimum, log per-fold institution mix.\n- category_id is not contiguous; build a map to [0..N-1] and keep inverse for submission.\n\n5) Path structure from metadata.json\n- Full path: train/images/<file_name> and test/images/<file_name>.\n- Quick verify:\n  - from PIL import Image; Image.open(train_dir/'images'/train_meta['images'][0]['file_name'])\n  - Also sample a few random metadata entries and check .exists().\n\nRecommended medal path (24h-minded)\n- Setup\n  - pip install torch/torchvision torchaudio (cu121), timm, albumentations, opencv-python, pandas, scikit-learn.\n  - Build a dataframe: image_path, image_id, category_id, label_idx (using a contiguous label map).\n- Model v1 (competitive single)\n  - Backbone: convnext_base.fb_in22k_ft_in1k, img_size=384, AMP on, AdamW, cosine, warmup, EMA optional.\n  - Augs: RandomResizedCrop(384), HFlip, ColorJitter moderate, Normalize; add MixUp/CutMix if stable.\n  - Sampler: WeightedRandomSampler (1/sqrt(freq)) or repeat-factor sampler; avoid extreme oversampling.\n  - Loss: CE + label_smoothing=0.1 (or Focal if CE underperforms).\n  - Train: 1 holdout fold for smoke, then 5-fold if time; 6–8 epochs with AMP; batch ~32–64 on A10 at 384 (tune).\n  - Track OOF macro-F1 and save OOF/test logits.\n- Inference and submission\n  - TTA (>=2 views). Apply logit adjustment (tune tau on OOF).\n  - Map label_idx back to original category_id. Ensure test row order follows test_meta['images'] order (matches sample_submission Id).\n- Ensembling (if time remains)\n  - Add EfficientNetV2-M@384 (or S). Average logits across models. Expect +0.02–0.03 macro-F1.\n\nImmediate actions (do these next)\n- Sanity-check image file access with a few metadata file_name paths.\n- Build label map and cached filelists for train/test.\n- Train convnext_base@384 with class-balanced sampling and CE+LS; produce first submission with 2x TTA + logit adjustment.\n- If OOF F1 looks stable, start a second diverse backbone (effnetv2_m or v2_s) and ensemble.\n\nKey reminders\n- Macro-F1 rewards rare classes; prioritize class-balanced exposure and logit adjustment.\n- Save and reuse fold splits and logits.\n- Don’t sink time into 224px or tiny models beyond a quick smoke test.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Ship a fast retrieval baseline today to get off 0, then train a single strong 384–512px classifier with long‑tail handling; ensemble/TTA if needed.\n\nImmediate (0–1 day): retrieval/prototype baseline (fastest path to bronze)\n- Encoder: OpenCLIP ViT-B/32 (preferred for speed) or timm vit_base_patch16_224. Single 224–256 center crop; optional hflip TTA.\n- Prototypes: For each species_id, compute L2‑normalized embeddings of 1–3 train images, mean per class → 64.5k prototypes.\n- Search: FAISS (IndexFlatIP or HNSW) with cosine similarity. For each test image embedding, take top‑1 prototype → species_id.\n- Submission hygiene: Keep sample_submission Id order exactly; Predicted must be the original species_id (map back from label indices); ints only; no missing rows.\n- Sanity checks: Run end‑to‑end on a small slice first to verify mapping/order and CSV format.\n\nCore single‑model path (1–3 days): fine‑grained classifier that respects the long tail\n- Resolution/arch: Start 384px minimum; fine‑tune to 448–512px. convnext_base or swin_b; AMP, cosine LR with warmup; AdamW; optional EMA; gradient accumulation if needed.\n- Validation: 5‑fold StratifiedKFold by species_id; if strong institution bias is seen, consider GroupKFold by institution. Track macro‑F1 OOF and per‑class F1. Save OOF/test logits.\n- Long‑tail handling (do at least one from each line):\n  - Sampling: Class‑balanced or class‑aware sampler; optionally cap 8–16 samples/class/epoch.\n  - Loss: Balanced Softmax/Class‑Balanced (effective number), Focal, or LDAM‑DRW. Keep label smoothing ~0.1.\n  - Schedule: Two‑stage/decoupled training (train head/backbone, then fine‑tune; optionally tail‑focused fine‑tune).\n- Augmentations:\n  - Strong but safe: RandomResizedCrop, H/V flips, modest ColorJitter; MixUp/CutMix. Optionally RandAug/TrivialAugment.\n  - Avoid over‑rotation/over‑jitter that erases label regions; herbarium scans can be sensitive.\n- Inference: Modest TTA (center + hflip, or 3–5 views). Ensure class id remap is correct.\n\nEfficiency and scale (to avoid stalls)\n- Data: Many workers (4–8), pin_memory, prefetch_factor; cache filelists/label encoders; mixed precision; gradient checkpointing if VRAM tight.\n- Iteration speed: Subsample for smoke tests; start smaller backbone/res then scale. Avoid massive 65k‑way heads with huge models initially.\n\nEnsembling and extensions (for silver+ or if baseline underperforms)\n- Blend logits across 5 folds and 2–3 diverse backbones/resolutions; add TTA.\n- Retrieval+classifier hybrid: use retrieval to shortlist candidates, re‑rank with the classifier.\n- Pseudo‑labeling after a stable single‑model CV/LB correlation.\n- Advanced later: hierarchical heads (genus/family), label/annotation crop stream, KD.\n\nCommon pitfalls that tank LB\n- Wrong ids or CSV order; predicting indices instead of species_id.\n- Random KFold on duplicate/near‑duplicate specimens inflating CV.\n- Training at 224px only; ignoring class imbalance; over‑augmentation that removes cues.\n- Dataloading bottlenecks; batch sizes so small they destabilize training.\n\nMilestones\n- Bronze: Retrieval baseline or single convnext_base@384 with class balancing + 5‑fold.\n- Silver: 3–5 model ensemble, 448–512px, TTA, stronger long‑tail loss.\n- Gold: Larger ensembles, multi‑scale, pseudo‑labels/hierarchical tricks.\n\nActionable summary\n1) Today: Implement embeddings + prototype retrieval (1–3 exemplars/class) with FAISS; submit after sanity checks.  \n2) Next: Train convnext_base@384 with class‑balanced sampler and CB/Focal/LDAM loss; 5‑fold CV; save logits; submit.  \n3) If < bronze: increase to 448–512, strengthen augs (MixUp/CutMix), try Swin‑B; add TTA.  \n4) Then: Ensemble folds/backbones; consider retrieval+classifier hybrid and pseudo‑labels.  \n5) Throughout: Guard mapping/order; optimize dataloaders/AMP; track macro‑F1 OOF and per‑class metrics."

    "llm_json": "**Assessing image availability for training**\n\nI realize that there are no files in the image directories. This means I can't train effectively since the actual images aren't present. In MLE-Benchmark, they often provide just metadata, expecting either dummy submissions or frequency-based ones. However, the expert I spoke with mentioned that images should be available, but here they’re shown as zero files. So, we need to devise a strategy using only the metadata. Even if we aim to predict most frequent classes, this would likely yield a low Macro-F1 score, making it tough to achieve our competition goals.**Exploring classifier options without images**\n\nI'm considering whether I could use annotations from the training data to build a classifier. Unfortunately, there’s only species frequencies and no text available, so inferring test labels isn't possible. I think it could be worth requesting another expert review, but we recently did that. Maybe checking the metadata for pseudo labels in the test annotations could help, although it's unlikely. The task instructions mention \"prepared artifacts,\" which suggests training might be expected without images. I wonder if there are precomputed features provided in the metadata. I’ll dig deeper into the keys to check for details like category_id and file_name patterns, but it looks like we can still produce a submission.csv, albeit with a poor score.**Addressing medal requirements without images**\n\nThe directive states that winning a medal is non-negotiable, but achieving that without images seems impossible. I’m considering whether I could implement a nearest-neighbor approach using numeric segments from the file names for test images, like ‘images/284/284652.jpg’ which would correspond to an image ID. But I’m somewhat concerned about potential overlaps between test and training image IDs. It seems more straightforward to just map the most frequent label for each test row, although a Macro-F1 with one class across so many could still lead to a score near zero. The train metadata has ‘institutions,’ which could help, but unfortunately, the test metadata doesn’t include this information.**Requesting expert review and planning submission**\n\nGiven the limitations in the environment, I should escalate the issue. I want to request an expert review to highlight the missing images, propose a fallback to dummy submissions, and ask what the acceptable baseline is for this benchmark. I’m considering adding a cell to inspect the filesystem, which shows zero files. I’ll pivot to creating a frequency prior submission to make at least a valid CSV, then will seek expert guidance again specifically about the missing files. I might need to check if they expect external downloads or retrieval methods with CLIP, but since there are no URLs, I’ll implement a quick submission that predicts the most frequent category based on training annotations. I think I need to parse those annotations to gather category_id counts and create the submission.csv with the top-k options, but it looks like the submission requires a single integer species_id for each Id.**Preparing submission with mode class**\n\nI’m planning to fill the submission with the mode category. I need to create a cell that will compute the mode category and write a submission.csv based on that. Once I do that, I can consider it as a \"final answer,\" even though the result might not be great. At least this way, I can establish a baseline and then check with an expert to confirm that the absence of images limits us to this approach.

    "llm_json": "**Improving metadata utilization**\n\nI’m considering the next steps in enhancing our data. We have a metadata-only baseline, but we need to go further. The available features in our train annotations include institution_id per image, but test images lack that field. I wonder if we can identify institutions based on width or license, given the differences in file name structures. Also, since the height and width of images vary, aspect ratio buckets might help. I need to think carefully through these options!**Predicting categories from file names**\n\nI'm exploring whether we can predict categories based on the file name patterns. For test images, the folder ranges from 000 to 477, which we could map to the top categories using train data. It seems that the train folder paths like images/604/92/1608432.jpg indicate the category_id, split into three-digit segments. With this structure, if the test image format is images/000/0.jpg, it likely means we can't determine its category since it’s represented differently. This will require more thought!**Exploring category mapping limitations**\n\nLooking at the example test ID '1' in the path images/000/1.jpg, it’s clear that mapping the training folder to categories won’t work for tests. While the training image ID matches the annotation ID, test IDs are sequential and non-overlapping, limiting our metadata usage. Interestingly, it looks like the images might be absent, as the directory shows \"(478 dirs, 0 files).\" So, I guess I have to optimally use the existing metadata, exploring width mapping to categories using weighted frequencies instead. But I’m worried about achieving a good macro-F1 score in this scenario—feels tough!**Enhancing predictions with dimensions**\n\nI’m considering ways to improve our predictions using a combination of width, height, and whether the width is odd or even. A LightGBM classifier could help predict the category_id based on these features, although I’m concerned it would still favor majority classes. In this dataset, width might correlate with institutions and species sets, allowing for slight improvements. Another idea is to use Naive Bayes with features like width and height, while mapping width to probability distributions could help too! Let's explore these options further!**Predicting institutions from dimensions**\n\nI noticed that the test metadata lacks institution_id, but I think we could predict the institution using width and height with a classifier. Distinct width patterns might help identify institutions, with varying most common categories per institution. Here’s the plan: First, build a mapping from (w, h) to the most common institution_id in the training data. Then, for each test (w, h), we’ll infer the institution and predict its top category, which could diversify our results beyond just global mapping.

I should combine ratios like width, height, greatest common divisor, and aspect ratios into buckets. Applying Naive Bayes with Laplace smoothing might help distribute predictions across various cat species based on their frequencies, potentially improving the macro-F1 score.

The last step regressed; we will revert to the (w,h)->w->global submission.\\n\\nAsk: Given image absence, how to maximize macro-F1 with metadata-only priors? Train metadata has: images list with file_name, width, height, id, license(0); annotations list with category_id, image_id, institution_id; categories list (64.5k). Test metadata has images with file_name, width, height, id, license(0). No institution_id in test. What strategies have worked in similar constraints?\\n\\nIdeas to validate with your guidance:\\n- Feature engineering from metadata: width, height, aspect ratio (w/h), gcd(w,h), parity of width/height, buckets (e.g., rounding to nearest 2/4/8), width mod k, height mod k; file_name-derived shards (first dir like '000'..'477', last part (id).jpg length), and image id numeric bins.\\n- Probabilistic priors: Build P(c|feat) via Naive Bayes over discretized features with Laplace smoothing; backoff/interpolation between (w,h,aspect shard)->(w,h)->w->global. Calibrate with temperature-like smoothing so rare classes get some probability mass and macro-F1 improves.\\n- Institution proxy: Our attempt mapping (w,h)->institution_id then top category collapsed to global top; should we instead use inst-specific category distributions blended with general priors (e.g., P(c|inst)*alpha + P(c|w,h)*(1-alpha)) where inst inferred by argmax P(inst|w,h) with smoothing?\\n- Ensembling metadata priors: average ranks/scores from different feature sets (e.g., (w,h), aspect buckets, width-bin, shard dir) and pick top-1.\\n- Any known metadata leakage signals in Herbarium 2021 (e.g., scanner-specific dimension patterns mapping to subsets of species) we can exploit safely? Recommended discretization schemes?\\n- Sanity: Ensure submission Predicted is original category_id; Id order matches test_meta['images'] order.\\n\\nDecision gates: If NB/backoff ensemble can lift macro-F1 noticeably over constant/global baseline, we\\u2019ll implement it now. Otherwise, confirm that this benchmark expects only metadata priors and set realistic ceiling. If you have a proven recipe (feature set + smoothing constants) for metadata-only Herbarium, please share exact steps/weights. Also confirm that downloading any subset of images is out of scope given time/size.\\n\\nNext actions after your advice: (1) Revert to best baseline (cell 6) and submit.

Using StratifiedShuffleSplit might work, but I should filter to ensure there are at least two instances per class. Alternatively, I could consider a simpler method similar to GroupKFold. I think I’ll compute the label counts, mark any rare classes, and assign them all to training before proceeding with a stratified split. Modifying cell 9 or adding a new cell to implement these changes sounds best. I'll likely insert a new cell to build a safer split using class counts and load the training data from the available variable.**Recalculating counts for stratified split**\n\nI'm going to recalculate the counts of each class using `value_counts()`. Then, I'll create a mask for the classes that have at least two instances. Using this mask, I'll separate the datasets into `df_strat` for classes that meet the requirement and `df_rare` for those that don't. I plan to apply StratifiedShuffleSplit to `df_strat` for a validation split of 0.2. After that, I’ll concatenate the training split with `df_rare`, save the data, and print the counts.

    "llm_json": "**Addressing interrupted validation**\n\nI need to move forward since the training validation was interrupted. It looks like we should either limit the validation steps or use a smaller subset for tuning tau. We saved the training checkpoint, but it only works if validation completes successfully. Since that didn’t happen, the best_f1 remains at -1, so we can't save a checkpoint. We really need to save the current model or run a quick validation to compute f1 and then save. Let's consider modifying the code to allow for this safety save.**Modifying for quick save**\n\nI’m thinking about adding a quick-save cell to load the model from current training. The model object is only available in cell 11, so after the interrupt, it’s gone. To fix this, I could rerun a quick pass to initialize the model, but that doesn’t sound great. A better idea is to rerun the training cell with zero training steps, then save immediately. I'll modify cell 11 to add MAX_VAL_STEPS and ensure we save a checkpoint after each epoch, even if best_f1 stays at -1.**Adjusting training parameters**\n\nI’m thinking about setting MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH to 1000 for a quicker process and MAX_VAL_STEPS to 200 batches, since 500 batches of 16 samples would result in around 8,000, which is reasonable time-wise. I’ll modify cell 11 accordingly. I need to adjust MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH, add MAX_VAL_STEPS, and limit the validation steps. Also, after validation, I should compute and save a checkpoint. If best_f1 remains -1, I’ll save that checkpoint as well.

    "turn_number": 45,
    "llm_json": "**Deciding next steps**\n\nI'm thinking it through: we have a checkpoint with low training steps and a validation F1 score of 0. Needs action! We should run inference in cell 12, even if it only yields mediocre results. A val F1 of 0 might be due to randomness or too few training steps, but predictions can still be made. \n\nCell 12 could process the entire validation set of 354k, which sounds long. Maybe I should modify it to sample a smaller subset or increase the batch size to 64.**Evaluating inference strategies**\n\nI can edit cell 12 to apply a cap, like setting `val_paths = val_paths[:5000]`. Running inference will also be over 477k images, which sounds extremely lengthy. Maybe I should skip test-time augmentation (TTA) for now and aim for a faster baseline submission with a single pass. \n\nConsidering time constraints, I could do a single view with a batch size of 64. Even so, it seems slow with my GPU, doing about 300 images per second—could take hours. I need a quicker approach since inferring the entire test set feels too heavy for this size!**Exploring image processing options**\n\nIn the MLE-Benchmark environment, images might be smaller, but I still have to deal with the huge size of 477,806 to process all. That's quite daunting! An alternative approach could be to use embeddings with a faster model like OpenCLIP ViT-B/32. However, that still means processing 2.2 million images, which feels impossible. \n\nI wonder if the grader might score using a smaller test set instead. Even with 477k to process, it could be worth trying a faster backbone like ResNet18. For a quick flow test, maybe I should only infer on a small chunk first.**Considering submission alternatives**\n\nI'm thinking about using the existing `submission.csv` from the metadata baseline. We could submit again later after improving my training. Following the workflow, I should run inference with batching but maybe disable TTA and use a lower resolution like 224 with a smaller model to speed things up. \n\nAlthough I trained the ConvNeXT model at 384, that mismatch should be fine. For cell 12, I’ll aim for single-view inference without horizontal flipping. I also need to sample the first 5,000 validation images for tau tuning and keep my batch size at 128 while using `torch.no_grad` for faster processing. Reducing the image size to 320 sounds like a plan, but it might still take too long.**Planning next steps for submissions**\n\nI think it makes sense to run validation tau tuning first, then look at increasing the training steps and epochs. Ultimately, I still need to produce a submission. So, I'll modify cell 12 to use single-view inference and cap the validation set at 2000 samples. \n\nRunning tests over 477k images will take quite a while, but I can manage that.

The instructions indicate I should use request_expert_review at major milestones, which seems timely now to ask about the training plan and whether to adjust inference. I could let it run for a bit to finish the validation phase, but I can also get feedback now on how to train effectively, including aspects like loss and sampling.**Exploring model adjustments**\n\nI’m considering various model techniques like logit calibration, temperature scaling, and label smoothing, while thinking about using smaller models for speed, like convnext_tiny or efficientnet_v2_s. Training for just one epoch feels too quick; we should probably aim for multiple epochs on subsets. Maybe we could discuss strong augmentations and class subsetting. Also, with 64.5k classes, using techniques like sampled softmax could be useful, but inference needs to predict all classes. We should think about fine-tuning with **in22k** for best results.**Formulating a training strategy**\n\nI'm considering a strategy to sample per-class images, starting with around four for initial epochs and then increasing the count. I might also utilize randaugment and a heavy sampler. It seems there could be some correlation with metadata regarding size, but it's minimal. I should check if hierarchical taxonomic mapping exists. For inference speed, it may take a while on a large dataset with a batch size of 64 at 320. I want to request expert review on the most efficient path to a medal in limited time.**Evaluating image retrieval strategy**\n\nI'm exploring an image retrieval method using a training gallery of 1.78M images, which may be heavy, but I think GPUs and FAISS can manage it. With 1.78M features at 1024 dimensions, that’s about 7GB for float32, or 3.5GB for float16, which seems feasible for a 24GB GPU. Storing this in CPU RAM works too, as there's 440GB available. I plan to compute features at 224 using a pretrained Convnext model, apply cosine similarity, and potentially achieve a decent macro-F1 score. I should ask experts if focusing on a feature-extractor with FAISS kNN is a quick route to reach the bronze level.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Context: Inference cell (12) is running now to produce our first image-based submission from a 1-epoch smoke model (ConvNeXt-Base @384 trained for 1k steps; val F1 ~0).

Specifics to review:\\n\\n1) Should we pivot to a kNN retrieval baseline using strong pretrained features (no/ minimal finetune) with FAISS? Plan: extract train/test embeddings with a high-quality timm backbone (e.g., convnext_large, vit_large_patch14_224, eva02_tiny/large if available via timm HF weights), normalize, then 1-NN or kNN with class-vote. Estimate: 1.78M train images -> features at 1024\\u20132048 dims, fp16 on CPU RAM (we have 440GB RAM), GPU-accelerated FAISS for search. Is this capable of Bronze/Silver quickly on this dataset? Which backbone/resolution and pooling do you recommend for best out-of-the-box features? Any tricks: whitening, PCA, ArcFace-like normalization, multi-crop pooling, or shard-wise indexing?\\n\\n2) If sticking with classification fine-tune, what minimal recipe moves the needle fastest?\\n   - Backbone/resolution: convnext_tiny/small @224 for rapid epochs vs convnext_base/large @320\\u2013384. Which gives best LB per GPU hour here?\\n   - Long-tail handling: WeightedRandomSampler (1/sqrt(freq)) vs focal/CB/LDAM. What wins here under time pressure?\\n   - Augs: RandAugment + Mixup/CutMix + random erasing? Any must-haves?\\n   - Optim schedule: AdamW + cosine + warmup; EMA yes/no; freeze stages for first N steps?\\n   - Curriculum: per-class K-sampling (e.g., 4\\u20138 imgs/class) for warm start, then broaden; or frequency-capped sampler.\\n   - Progressive resizing: 224 -> 320/384 feasible within 24h?\\n\\n3) Calibration/inference:\\n   - Our current logit adjustment with class priors (tau) on val subset: is this beneficial for macro-F1 on this competition? Better alternatives (temperature scaling, bias correction)?\\n   - Single-view 320 vs TTA: recommended light TTA that is worth it?\\n\\n4) Validation protocol: We did a safe 80/20 holdout excluding singletons from val. Any better CV for this competition to avoid leakage or bias (e.g., institution-aware split)?\\n\\n5) Ensembling: If we can produce 2\\u20133 diverse models/feature extractors, what simple blending (averaging logits, rank averaging, kNN vote blend) tends to help most for macro-F1 here?\\n\\nGiven the dataset scale, please prioritize a concrete, medal-oriented plan for the next 6\\u201310 hours. If kNN retrieval can get us to Bronze/Silver fastest, outline the exact model(s), resolution, and FAISS settings to use, as well as memory tips.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Executive summary\n- Fastest safe medal path in 6–10h: frozen-feature nearest-class-centroid (NCC) using a strong pretrained backbone, plus a short convnext_base@384 fine-tune in parallel, then blend. NCC gives you a quick Bronze baseline; the blend can push toward Silver. Instance-level kNN over 1.78M is riskier/slower; only try it if you’ve got slack.\n\nWhat to do next (order of execution)\n1) Let your current inference finish and submit (sanity).\n2) Start NCC now (primary). In parallel after NCC extraction starts, launch a 2–3 epoch convnext_base fine-tune (secondary).\n3) Blend adjusted logits (classifier) with adjusted NCC sims; submit. If time, add one more frozen-feature extractor for a small bump.\n\nPlan A: NCC baseline (frozen features; no FAISS)\n- Backbone/resolution:\n  - convnext_base.fb_in22k_ft_in1k at 320 or 384. Start 320 for throughput; 384 if you’re still GPU-idle.\n  - If you can afford heavier: convnext_large_mlp.clip_laion2b_soup_ft_in12k_in1k_384 or eva02_large_patch14_336 (timm). They yield stronger features; use if memory allows.\n- Features:\n  - Use timm num_classes=0 to get pooled features. L2-normalize features. Optional: GeM pooling if model supports; otherwise default global avg is fine.\n  - Optional 2-view feature (center + hflip) averaged; cheap + helpful.\n- Centroids:\n  - Stream train once, accumulate per-class sum in fp32, counts in int, then centroid = sum/count. L2-normalize centroids. Store centroids as fp16 on disk.\n  - Memory: 64.5k x 1024 fp16 ~ 134 MB.\n- Scoring:\n  - Extract test features (same pipeline), L2-normalize.\n  - Compute sims = test_feats @ centroids.T (cosine). Do in chunks on GPU (e.g., 4096–8192 rows per mm).\n  - Predict argmax; optionally weight with 2-view.\n- Calibration:\n  - Compute class priors from your train_split.\n  - Logit (similarity) adjustment: sims_adj = sims - tau*log(prior); grid tau in [0.5, 1.5] on your val subset; pick best for macro-F1.\n- Expected: Bronze quickly; with strong backbone + 2-view + tau, you can approach/enter Silver.\n\nPlan B: Short fine-tune (run alongside NCC)\n- Model/resolution: convnext_base.fb_in22k_ft_in1k @384. Batch 32–48 with AMP on A10; num_workers 8; pin_memory, persistent_workers.\n- Sampler: WeightedRandomSampler with weight ~ 1/sqrt(freq). Keep your “safe split” but prefer group-aware CV below for reliability.\n- Loss: CrossEntropy + label smoothing 0.05–0.1. Under time pressure, skip focal/CB/LDAM.\n- Augs: RandomResizedCrop(384) + HFlip + light ColorJitter; Random Erasing p=0.1 optional. If stable, add light Mixup (alpha=0.2). Skip heavy augs that slow throughput.\n- Optim: AdamW (lr 1e-4–2e-4, wd 1e-4), cosine, 5% warmup, AMP. EMA optional; only if it doesn’t slow loop (decay ~0.995–0.9995).\n- Schedule: 2–3 full epochs now. Cap val to 20–50k samples during training for speed; do full-val once before inference. No stage freezing needed.\n- Inference: 320–384 single view + hflip TTA (2x). Apply tau-prior adjustment; tune tau on val.\n\nOptional Plan C: Instance-level kNN with FAISS (do only if NCC + short FT is underwhelming and you have time)\n- Features: strongest available (CLIP/EVA ViT-L/ConvNeXt-L) @336–384, L2-normalize. Optional PCA to 512 dims to speed search.\n- FAISS: GPU IndexIVFFlat or IVFPQ with IP (cosine after L2). Start with:\n  - nlist ~ 8192, nprobe 32–64. For IVFPQ: m=64, nbits=8. Train on a 1–2M sample subset. Add all train feats (fp16). Query k=5–10.\n- Voting: majority vote or distance-weighted vote (softmax over similarities with temperature ~5).\n- Caveat: Full 1.78M index + 478k queries is heavy to run and tune under 24h; NCC is far simpler and much faster.\n\nValidation protocol\n- Your rare-class-safe 80/20 split is fine. Better: make it institution-aware to avoid leakage bias. Use StratifiedGroupKFold (or a single holdout) with group=institution_id on the stratifiable subset; keep singletons in train.\n\nEnsembling/blending (macro-F1)\n- Best simple blend: weighted sum of adjusted logits.\n  - Get classifier logits_adj (tau applied) and NCC sims_adj (apply same tau, optionally temperature-scale NCC sims to match magnitude, T ~0.05–0.1).\n  - Blend: 0.6*cls + 0.4*ncc (tune 0.5–0.7 on val).\n- If you add a second frozen extractor (e.g., CLIP ConvNeXt-L or EVA-L), average its centroids with the first (feature-space aligned if same model family) or average its adjusted sims at score level.\n\nLight TTA worth using\n- 2x (orig + hflip) for classifier; for NCC, 2-view features averaged. Heavier TTA is not ROI-positive under time.\n\nConcrete 6–10h timeline\n- Hour 0–0.5: Submit current model output.\n- Hour 0–3: NCC feature extraction for train (centroid accumulation) @320/384, 2-view optional; then test features.\n- Hour 3–3.5: NCC scoring + tau tuning on val subset; submit NCC.\n- Hour 0.5–6 (parallel): Start convnext_base@384 fine-tune, 2–3 epochs. After epoch 2, validate, run 2x TTA inference with tau, submit.\n- Hour 6–8: Blend classifier + NCC (adjusted), tune weights on val, submit.\n- Hour 8–10: If time, add a stronger frozen extractor (CLIP/EVA), recompute NCC sims and re-blend.\n\nBackbone picks (out-of-the-box feature strength)\n- Safest: convnext_base.fb_in22k_ft_in1k @384.\n- Stronger (if available/fit): convnext_large_mlp.clip_laion2b_soup_ft_in12k_in1k_384 or eva02_large_patch14_clip_336; use L2-normalized pooled features. GeM pooling if model supports; else default.\n\nMemory/perf tips\n- Use AMP everywhere; store features/centroids in fp16 (accumulate centroids in fp32, cast at end).\n- Chunk scoring (torch.mm) by 2–8k rows.\n- Large batches: ~128 @320 for NCC; ~32–48 @384 for classifier on A10.\n- Avoid full-val every epoch; cap to 20–50k.\n\nExpected outcomes\n- NCC alone: likely Bronze quickly; with strong backbone + 2-view + tau, can brush Silver.\n- 2–3 epoch convnext_base + NCC blend: strongest chance at Silver within 6–10h.\n\nAnswers to your specific bullets\n1) kNN retrieval: Yes for Bronze; Silver is possible with strong features and tweaks, but under time use NCC over instance-level kNN. If you do kNN: use CLIP/EVA large backbones @336–384, L2 norm, FAISS IVFFlat (nlist~8192, nprobe 32–64) or IVFPQ (m=64, nbits=8). Distance-weighted vote.\n2) Minimal fine-tune: convnext_base@384; WeightedRandomSampler 1/sqrt(freq); CE+LS; RRCrop+HFlip(+RE p=0.1); AdamW+cosine+5% warmup; EMA optional; no freezing; no progressive resizing; 2–3 epochs now.\n3) Calibration/inference: tau-prior adjustment helps; tune 0.5–1.5. Temperature scaling is minor. TTA: 2x hflip only.\n4) Validation: Your safe split is fine; better: group by institution_id to reduce bias.\n5) Ensembling: Weighted average of adjusted logits beats rank averaging. Blend classifier (0.6) + NCC (0.4); add a second frozen extractor if time.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: run a real image-model training for 20k–30k steps with long‑tail‑aware loss/sampling, validate with institution‑grouped CV, and lift inference via prior correction, light TTA, and prototype blending; then add a small ensemble.\n\nImmediate actions (now)\n- Submit an image-based prediction: run your ready inference cell to verify the end-to-end path and establish a baseline.\n- Launch proper training: remove MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH cap; target 20k–30k optimizer steps.

Keep effective batch 32–64 via grad accumulation if needed.\n- Imbalance handling (macro-F1 oriented):\n  - Sampling: class-aware/repeat-factor sampling (more aggressive than 1/√freq; cap head exposure per epoch).\n  - Loss: Class-Balanced Focal (beta≈0.9999, gamma≈1.5) or LDAM-DRW; label smoothing small (≈0.05).\n  - EMA: enable model EMA (decay 0.999–0.9997) for better generalization.\n- Augmentations (mild, global):\n  - RandAug/TrivialAug; Mixup 0.1 + CutMix 0.1; RandomErasing low prob.\n  - Cropping: avoid aggressive crops; scale ≥0.85 with center bias; specimen sheets need global context.\n- Warm start: optionally freeze backbone for first 500–1000 steps, then unfreeze.\n\nValidation/CV you can trust\n- Keep “safe split” for singletons in train. Prefer 3–5 fold GroupKFold grouped by institution_id to mirror domain shift.\n- Evaluate macro-F1 on a large val slice (≥50k samples) or a class-balanced subset; early stop on macro-F1.\n- Log per-class or tail-bin F1 to verify rare-class recall improves.\n\nInference boosts that move the needle\n- Prior correction: subtract τ·log(prior) using train priors; grid-search τ in [0.0, 2.0] (step 0.1) on a solid val set.\n- Light TTA: 2–4 views (center + horizontal flip/short-side flip); average logits.\n- Prototypes/KNN: extract L2-normalized train embeddings, build class prototypes (mean per class), score test by cosine similarity; blend with classifier logits (start 0.5/0.5, tune). If compute-bound, use a few reps per class.\n- Optional: temperature scaling on val for calibration.\n\nScale to secure and exceed bronze\n- Progressive resize fine-tune at 384/448 for a few thousand steps.\n- Train 2–4 diverse models (e.g., EfficientNetV2-S/M, ViT-B/Swin, different seeds/resolutions) and average logits; typical +0.05–0.10 macro-F1.\n- If time allows: pseudo-label high-confidence test predictions to reinforce the tail.\n\nPitfalls to avoid\n- Undertraining (1k steps, tiny val caps) and LR schedules that decay to near-zero early.\n- Plain CE + random sampling (head bias) and over-reliance on metadata heuristics.\n- Over-aggressive cropping, too low resolution (224 only), weak CV (no grouping by institution), tiny/unstable validation, or misaligned label mapping.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Submit an image-model prediction now; then train convnext_base at 320–384 for 20k–30k steps with AdamW (lr≈2e-4, wd=0.1), cosine + 5–10% warmup, AMP, EMA, class-aware sampling, and CB-Focal (beta≈0.9999, gamma≈1.5, LS≈0.05).\n- Validate with GroupKFold by institution and a large val slice; early stop on macro-F1.\n- At inference, apply τ·log-prior correction (τ tuned), light TTA, and prototype–logit blending.\n- Add a second backbone and ensemble to comfortably clear bronze and push higher.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-29 04:35:43] Cell 12 in `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb` has been executing for 249s and is still executing.

    "llm_json": "**Considering execution flow**\n\nI have inference running right now. The next step, according to the expert, is to let it finish and then start the NCC pipeline in parallel. But the tricky part is that we can't execute a new cell while one is running, although we can create or edit a new notebook. It seems we can run multiple notebooks, but the execution environment could create contention, especially since NCC feature extraction needs the GPU. I could prepare the NCC code cells for execution after the current task finishes.**Planning NCC implementation**\n\nI need to insert a new cell at index 13 for the NCC frozen feature pipeline. This involves implementing feature extraction with a timm backbone, using num_classes=0, L2 normalization, and computing centroids from the training split with label_idx mapping. We have options for 2-view and tau tuning on the validation subset. Scoring will be done using cosine similarity. \n\nI'll keep batch size at 128 and set up for streaming accumulation per class. I should check the output shape from the model to ensure it matches our needs. Finally, I need to confirm the dataset and transformations.**Setting up feature extraction**\n\nI’m planning to reuse the validation transformations like center cropping and use Resize for the shorter side, aiming for either 384 or 320 pixels. I’ll also include horizontal flipping for test-time augmentation, averaging the features from two views. \n\nImplementation steps include defining a transformation for an inference size of 320, setting up a dataset to load the file path and optional label index, and creating a function to extract features. For feature extraction, I could concatenate original and flipped images, but to save time, it may be more effective to process them in batches. \n\nLastly, I need to compute the per-class centroids by accumulating sums and counts from the training split, ensuring the arrays are correctly shaped and normalized.**Extracting and saving features**\n\nI’ll save the data to .npy format as fp16. The next step is to extract test features by processing the test DataFrame similarly, getting features, L2-normalizing the rows, and computing similarity with centroids using torch.mm on the GPU. It’s important to chunk the test feature matrix for efficiency.\n\nFor tau tuning, I need to run on a validation subset using the val_split labels, computing features and similarities against centroids built from the training data. I’ll evaluate using an F1 score while trying a tau range from 0.5 to 1.5.\n\nFinally, I’ll save various files including centroids and submission files while keeping an eye on memory constraints.**Deciding on batch size**\n\nI'm considering the batch size for feature extraction with ConvNeXt Base at 320. Using 128 might be too high, so I think opting for a safer size of 64 or 96 could be better. It’s crucial to log the elapsed time as well. I’ll go ahead and implement cell 13 based on this, making sure it accommodates the batch size adjustments. This way, we can ensure smoother processing and avoid potential memory issues.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 13,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# NCC (Nearest Class Centroid) frozen-feature baseline with tau-prior adjustment\",\n      \"import os, time, json, math, gc\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"import torch\",\n      \"import torch.nn.functional as F\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"import torchvision.transforms as T\",\n      \"from PIL import Image\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\",\n      \"import timm\",\n      \"\",\n      \"torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True\",\n      \"device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Load splits & label maps\",\n      \"trn_split = pd.read_pickle('train_split.pkl')\",\n      \"val_split = pd.read_pickle('val_split.pkl')\",\n      \"test_df   = pd.read_pickle('test_df.pkl')\",\n      \"with open('idx2cat.json','r') as f:\",\n      \"    idx2cat = {int(k): int(v) for k,v in json.load(f).items()}\",\n      \"with open('cat2idx.json','r') as f:\",\n      \"    cat2idx = {int(k): int(v) for k,v in json.load(f).items()}\",\n      \"num_classes = len(idx2cat)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Model / transforms\",\n      \"MODEL_NAME = 'convnext_base.fb_in22k_ft_in1k'\",\n      \"IMG_SIZE = 320  #

    "llm_json": "**Reevaluating feature extraction**\n\nI’m thinking about implementing changes one step at a time, then perhaps taking a quick 5-10 minute break before proceeding. The NCC process seems really time-consuming, especially with 1.4 million rows to process. This could take over ten hours! To expedite things, I should consider computing per-class centroids by sampling only a few images per class, say 4-8. Modifying the NCC cell to incorporate this sampling is critical before I execute any further steps.**Optimizing training subsampling**\n\nI’m thinking about switching to a subsampling strategy for training. The idea is to group by label and sample up to K images per class, starting with K set at 4 or maybe 8. This still yields a large dataset of around 258,000 images, which is manageable within a few hours, especially using a batch size of 128. I plan to implement this by building a specific segment of code to sample images and store counts for priors, all while ensuring we compute centroids efficiently. Plus, I need to improve our two-view efficiency by utilizing transforms with a Flip flag instead of manually building batches.**Simplifying batch construction**\n\nI realize that constructing batch1 using list comprehension is still a viable approach, even though it doesn’t leverage parallel loading through DataLoader. To simplify and speed things up, I think we should set TWO_VIEW to False for now and modify cell 13 accordingly. Testing feature extraction requires using all samples, and while the validation set is manageable, the test extraction of 477,000 images will take time, likely between 6 and 10 hours. So, I’ll adjust the batch size to 128 and edit the centroid computation to avoid pulling everything from the entire training set.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 13,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# NCC (Nearest Class Centroid) frozen-feature baseline with tau-prior adjustment (K-per-class sampling)\",\n      \"import os, time, json, math, gc\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"import torch\",\n      \"import torch.nn.functional as F\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"import torchvision.transforms as T\",\n      \"from PIL import Image\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\",\n      \"import timm\",\n      \"\",\n      \"torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True\",\n      \"device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Load splits & label maps\",\n      \"trn_split = pd.read_pickle('train_split.pkl')\",\n      \"val_split = pd.read_pickle('val_split.pkl')\",\n      \"test_df   = pd.read_pickle('test_df.pkl')\",\n      \"with open('idx2cat.json','r') as f:\",\n      \"    idx2cat = {int(k): int(v) for k,v in json.load(f).items()}\",\n      \"with open('cat2idx.json','r') as f:\",\n      \"    cat2idx = {int(k): int(v) for k,v in json.load(f).items()}\",\n      \"num_classes = len(idx2cat)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Model / transforms\",\n      \"MODEL_NAME = 'convnext_base.fb_in22k_ft_in1k'\",\n      \"IMG_SIZE = 320  #

    "llm_json": "**Assessing notebook execution**\n\nI think it’s better to wait for the inference to finish and then execute cell 13 to start NCC. After that, could we launch another notebook in parallel? I’m unsure if the environment supports multiple executions since it mentions running multiple threads. The tools seem to allow only one execution at a time. It’s probably safer to run things serially, so I’m considering a sleep duration of about 10 minutes. I also noticed a potential bug with cell 13 related to the 'reset_index' usage, which might be incorrect.**Modifying the code for execution**\n\nI realized that in our modified version, we need to fix a peculiar check before running. It's better to simply sort and use `reset_index(drop=True)` without the weird check. I should modify that line now to avoid any runtime errors later by changing it to:\n\n`sub = sub.sort_values('Id').reset_index(drop=True)`\n\nI also want to test that feature extraction returns `t_feats` and `t_ids`, but it's okay to ignore `t_ids`. I’m cautious about the batch size being 128 at 320 — it might lead to out-of-memory issues, but I think I’ll keep it as is. I'll edit the code now, then plan to sleep for 10 minutes later.

But I won’t run it just yet. Once the current inference finishes, I need to execute cell 13. I think a good idea is to sleep for about 12 minutes to check the progress, but I won’t add any verbose details. Although adding fine-tune code could help later, I'll hold off editing for now and just stick with this plan.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"sleep\",\n  \"sleep_payload\": {\n    \"sleep_duration_minutes\": 12\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Inference (cell 12) is at ~128k/477k and progressing.

I can set up a training pipeline by creating cell 14, which involves editing rather than executing code. It’s important to ensure it’s ready for after the inference or to run in parallel, but I’ll have to keep track of the execution limits. I think I’ll prepare a robust training cell with a proper schedule. It’s good to follow expert advice at these milestones too!**Setting up training parameters**\n\nI'm planning to train convnext_base for 2 epochs, considering removing the cap on MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH. To manage time, I could set it to 20,000 steps instead. I’ll base this on the previous training cell but make adjustments like setting MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH to 20,000 and including a validation cap. I'm also noting the need to fix any deprecated code. While adding EMA might seem like a complex change, I think I’ll keep it simpler. I'll prepare the code for cell 14, tweaking parameters accordingly.

I want to execute cell 14 next, but I should seek expert advice first to ensure I'm using the best configuration.

I plan to run Cell 14: 2-epoch fine-tune of convnext_base.fb_in22k_ft_in1k at 384px, batch 32, AdamW LR=2e-4, WD=1e-4, label smoothing 0.05, cosine+warmup, AMP, class-balanced WeightedRandomSampler (1/sqrt(freq)), simple torchvision augs (RRCrop/HFlip/ColorJitter). Val capped at 1000 batches. After training, I will run a fast single-view inference with prior-tau adjustment, and possibly blend with the NCC logits (already computed centroids on K=4 per class). Questions: 1) Is convnext_base@384 the right speed/accuracy tradeoff for ~2-3h window, or should I switch to efficientnet_v2_m/s or convnext_large/tiny, or drop to 320 for throughput? 2) Should I add MixUp/CutMix (timm\\u2019s AugMix/RandAug/Mixup) to stabilize long-tail training quickly, or keep it simple given only 2 epochs? 3) Any recommended loss/sampler tweaks for this long-tail (CB/focal/LDAM vs current LS+weighted sampler) that pay off in 2 epochs? 4) Freezing strategy: train head+last stage for first epoch then unfreeze all for second\\u2014worth it here? 5) Optimizer: stick with AdamW, or use timm RMSpropTF/SGD+momentum, or SAM+AdamW for quick gains under short training? 6) Inference: is simple single-view + prior-tau good enough, or should I budget HFlip TTA or 5-crop to push macro-F1? 7) Any pitfalls with our safe split (rare classes kept only in train) for macro-F1 stability? 8) If you had to hit Bronze fast: what exact config (backbone, size, epochs, augs, loss) would you run now?

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the shortest path to a medal, distilled from all four reviews and your current notebook.\n\nKey fixes from your smoke tests\n- Your 1k-step epoch is far too short; that’s why val macro-F1 stayed 0.0. You need ~30k+ steps total to move the needle.\n- Your NCC with K=4 per class is too sparse; only blend it if it shows non-trivial val macro-F1.\n\nAnswers to your 8 questions\n1) Backbone/size: Keep convnext_base.fb_in22k_ft_in1k but drop to 320px to maximize useful updates in your 2–3h window. Throughput > resolution here. Don’t switch backbones now.\n2) MixUp/CutMix: Skip for this 2-epoch sprint. They need more epochs or careful tuning. If you want a tiny regularization bump, add RandomErasing p=0.1 only.\n3) Loss/sampler: Keep CE with label smoothing + WeightedRandomSampler(1/sqrt(freq)). It’s the best “works-now” combo for 2 epochs. If you want a touch more regularization, set LS to 0.1.\n4) Freezing: Don’t freeze; full end-to-end from the start.\n5) Optimizer: Stick with AdamW + cosine + ~5% warmup. Skip SAM/RMSpropTF/SGD in this timebox.\n6) Inference: Do 2x TTA (orig + HFlip), then apply prior-tau. It’s cheap and usually gives +0.01–0.02 macro-F1. Skip multi-crop.\n7) Safe split: It’s fine. Just tune tau on a reasonably large and diverse val subset (20–50k). Expect val F1 to be imperfect on the tail; that’s okay.\n8) Bronze-now exact config: See “Implement now” below.\n\nImplement now (minimal changes)\nTraining (Cell 14):\n- IMG_SIZE = 320\n- BATCH_SIZE = 48 (fallback 40 if OOM; 64 if it fits)\n- EPOCHS = 2\n- MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH = 15000  # ~30k total steps in ~2–3h on A10 with AMP\n- MAX_VAL_STEPS = 1000\n- LR = 2e-4 (keep)\n- WD = 1e-4 (keep)\n- LS_EPS = 0.1\n- Augs: add RandomErasing(p=0.1) after Normalize in train_tfms\n\nNotes:\n- Keep WeightedRandomSampler(1/sqrt(freq)).\n- Keep AdamW + cosine+warmup.\n- No MixUp/CutMix. No freezing.\n\nInference (your Cell 12 flow):\n- Use 2x TTA (orig + HFlip), average logits, then subtract tau*log(prior).\n- Tune tau on 20–50k val samples over [0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2].\n- Batch size 64–96 at 320.\n\nNCC blend (optional, only if it helps):\n- Compute NCC val macro-F1 on a 20k slice. If >0.02, blend: blended = 0.6*fine_tune_logits + 0.4*ncc_scores (after same tau). If ≤0.02, skip blending to avoid dilution.\n\nConcrete edit snippets\n- In Cell 14 config:\n  - IMG_SIZE = 320\n  - BATCH_SIZE = 48\n  - EPOCHS = 2\n  - MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH = 15000\n  - LS_EPS = 0.1\n- Add RandomErasing to train_tfms:\n  - After Normalize, add T.RandomErasing(p=0.1, scale=(0.02, 0.1), ratio=(0.3, 3.3))\n- Keep your LabelSmoothingCE; no MixUp changes needed.\n\n- In inference:\n  - Run logits on original and HFlip; average logits first, then apply tau adjustment.\n  - Tune tau on 20–50k val subset with the same 320 pipeline.\n\nWhy this wins now\n- 320px + bigger batch + capped steps maximizes effective updates in 2–3h.\n- CE+LS + WRS converges fast on long-tail in short runs.\n- 2x HFlip TTA and tau-priors are cheap, consistent boosts.\n- NCC blend is only worth it if your NCC is at least mildly competent on val; otherwise skip to avoid hurting the fine-tuned model.\n\nDo this in order\n1) Edit Cell 14 as above; launch training immediately.\n2) While training, prep 2x TTA inference with tau tuning over 20–50k val.\n3) After training:\n   - Run 2x TTA inference at 320, tune tau, generate submission.\n   - Optionally evaluate NCC on val; blend only if val macro-F1 > 0.02.\n4) Submit. If time remains, a second quick run (same recipe) seeds a small blend for a few more points.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: run a parallel retrieval + classifier plan, handle the long tail explicitly, and blend with calibrated logits; validate with institution-aware CV; scale only after a working baseline.\n\n1) Retrieval track (fast jump in F1)\n- Switch NCC features to stronger ViT embeddings:\n  - MODEL_NAME: vit_large_patch14_dinov2 (or eva02_large_patch14 / OpenCLIP ViT-L/14 if available).\n  - IMG_SIZE: 224–336; BATCH: as high as fits; L2-normalize embeddings and centroids.\n- Sampling: K_PER_CLASS=6–8 (increase to 10–20 if time).\n- Scoring: cosine similarity to centroids; tune tau on val; enable TWO_VIEW=True (center + hflip).\n- Optional boost: local kNN re-ranking (k=5–20) around the top centroid class.\n\n2) Classifier track (make Cell 14 finish and learn)\n- Run Cell 14 with real training:\n  - EPOCHS=5 (min 3), MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH≈40k, early stop on val macro-F1.\n  - Keep class-aware sampling (1/sqrt(freq)). Replace loss with focal (gamma 1–2) or class-balanced/Balanced Softmax; reduce label smoothing.\n  - Head warmup: train classifier head (+ last block) for 1–2 epochs, then unfreeze all.\n  - Augs: RandomResizedCrop, HFlip, light ColorJitter; add MixUp/CutMix (alpha 0.2–0.4).\n  - Resolution: start 320–384 to finish reliably; scale to 448 once stable.\n  - Inference: TTA 2–4 views (center at 1–2 scales + hflip). Temperature-scale logits and/or apply prior adjustment (tau).\n\n3) Blend and calibrate\n- Blend classifier logits and retrieval scores (map similarities to pseudo-logits), weight ~0.7 classifier / 0.3 retrieval; tune weight on val F1.\n- Apply prior/temperature calibration after blending.\n\n4) Validation/CV and leakage control\n- Extend “safe split” to 3–5 folds; consider institution-aware folds to reduce CV–LB gap.\n- Track OOF macro-F1 and per-class F1; aim for val macro-F1 >0.10 before scaling.\n- Keep label mappings fixed across all pipelines; verify idx↔category consistency.\n\n5) Efficiency to avoid timeouts\n- AMP, gradient accumulation, larger effective batch.\n- Dataloader: num_workers 8, pin_memory, prefetch_factor 2; persistent_workers.\n- Chunk test inference; cache extracted features/logits to disk; monitor GPU with nvidia-smi.\n\n6) If plateaued below ~0.13\n- Increase K_PER_CLASS and/or add kNN in retrieval; try DINOv2/EVA at 320–384.\n- Swap/scale backbone: ConvNeXt-L/EfficientNetV2-M or ViT-S at 384–448.\n- Try LDAM-DRW or Balanced Softmax; adjust focal gamma; add RandAugment.\n- Add a small second model for a tiny ensemble; optional metadata backoff (institution-aware prior) for low-confidence cases.\n\nActionable checklist (in order)\n- Cell 13: change backbone to DINOv2/EVA; set IMG_SIZE=224–336, K_PER_CLASS=6–8, TWO_VIEW=True; rebuild centroids; tau-tune; produce submission.\n- Cell 14: set EPOCHS=5, MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH≈40000; use focal or class-balanced loss; head warmup; add MixUp/CutMix; run to completion; TTA + temperature scaling; produce submission.\n- Blend both submissions (logits/similarities) with 0.7/0.3; tune on val; submit.\n- Move to 3–5-fold CV; if time remains, raise resolution/backbone strength and re-blend."

After that, I can either run a new cell for single-view testing with tau set at 0.6 or stick with the existing run_test_inference function that includes TTA. Since time is not an issue, I can take these steps one at a time. First up: restarting the kernel!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"execute_code\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"code_execution_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"restart_kernel\"\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Kernel died during long 2x TTA inference.

After this, the next step will involve restarting the kernel and executing cell 15 to reload code definitions. It's important to remember that a kernel restart clears the state, but I have functions defined in other cells that I can use. I'll need to be mindful of that!**Considering inference approach**\n\nI might consider reusing the existing run_test_inference function but with a lower batch size. It currently uses 2x TTA, which could save time, but TTA previously took over 3 hours. Only the last chunk failed due to the kernel dying, and re-running the whole set seems too lengthy. A single-view might be a better option to complete in about 1.5 hours. So, after the restart, I’ll insert a cell for single-view inference with tau set at 0.6.

The notebook kernel is idle, so I should add a new cell for efficient inference while being careful with batching and progress. Requesting expert review at significant milestones, like final inference, is important, but executing is more urgent. I might also consider implementing resumable chunked inference writing periodically to avoid losing progress. But perhaps sticking to a simpler approach with batch size 128 and no TTA is best.**Planning code execution**\n\nI need to create a new cell (index 17) that loads the model and checkpoint. It should define a DataLoader using a simple dataset and transformations over test_df. I'll iterate through the data, compute logits with argmax after adjusting for a fixed tau of 0.6 to avoid saving unnecessary logits. I'll map to category IDs and write the submission while logging progress every N batches. Also, I’ll periodically flush a partial CSV every 100k rows and write the final output at the end. Finally, I'll insert the code cell and prepare for execution, but just for editing first.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 17,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Fast, reliable single-view inference with fixed tau=0.6 and periodic checkpoints\",\n      \"import os, time, json, math, gc\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"import torch\",\n      \"import torchvision.transforms as T\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"from PIL import Image\",\n      \"import timm\",\n      \"\",\n      \"torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True\",\n      \"device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Load artifacts\",\n      \"val_split = pd.read_pickle('val_split.pkl')  # not strictly needed, but kept for consistency\",\n      \"trn_split = pd.read_pickle('train_split.pkl')\",\n      \"test_df = pd.read_pickle('test_df.pkl')\",\n      \"with open('idx2cat.json','r') as f:\",\n      \"    idx2cat = {int(k): int(v) for k,v in json.load(f).items()}\",\n      \"num_classes = len(idx2cat)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"IMG_SIZE = 320\",\n      \"MODEL_NAME = 'convnext_base.fb_in22k_ft_in1k'\",\n      \"CKPT_PATH = 'model_convnext_base_320_ft_best.pth'\",\n      \"TAU = 0.6  # fixed from prior tuning\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Priors from training split\",\n      \"counts = trn_split['label_idx'].value_counts().sort_index()\",\n      \"priors = counts.reindex(range(num_classes), fill_value=1).values.astype(np.float64)\",\n      \"priors = priors / priors.sum()\",\n      \"log_priors = torch.from_numpy(np.log(priors + 1e-12)).to(device).float()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"val_tfms = T.Compose([\",\n      \"    T.Resize(IMG_SIZE, interpolation=T.InterpolationMode.BICUBIC),\",\n      \"    T.CenterCrop(IMG_SIZE),\",\n      \"    T.ToTensor(),\",\n      \"    T.Normalize(mean=(0.485,0.456,0.406), std=(0.229,0.224,0.225)),\",\n      \"])\",\n      \"\",\n      \"class TestDS(Dataset):\",\n      \"    def __init__(self, df):\",\n      \"        self.df = df.reset_index(drop=True)\",\n      \"    def __len__(self):\",\n      \"        return len(self.df)\",\n      \"    def __getitem__(self, i):\",\n      \"        r = self.df.iloc[i]\",\n      \"        p = r['file_path']\",\n      \"        try:\",\n      \"            img = Image.open(p).convert('RGB')\",\n      \"        except Exception:\",\n      \"            img = Image.fromarray(np.ones((IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, 3), dtype=np.uint8)*255)\",\n      \"        x = val_tfms(img)\",\n      \"        return x, int(r['Id'])\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def load_model():\",\n      \"    model = timm.create_model(MODEL_NAME, pretrained=False, num_classes=num_classes)\",\n      \"    ck = torch.load(CKPT_PATH, map_location='cpu')\",\n      \"    model.load_state_dict(ck['model'], strict=True)\",\n      \"    model.to(device).eval()\",\n      \"    return model\",\n      \"\",\n      \"@torch.inference_mode()\",\n      \"def run_single_view_infer():\",\n      \"    ds = TestDS(test_df)\",\n      \"    # Use conservative batch for stability; OOM-safe backoff not needed for single-view\",\n      \"    bs = 128\",\n      \"    dl = DataLoader(ds, batch_size=bs, shuffle=False, num_workers=min(8, os.cpu_count() or 8), pin_memory=True, persistent_workers=True)\",\n      \"    model = load_model()\",\n      \"    preds_idx = np.empty((len(ds),), dtype=np.int32)\",\n      \"    t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"    done = 0\",\n      \"    for it, (xb, ids) in enumerate(dl):\",\n      \"        xb = xb.to(device, non_blocking=True)\",\n      \"        with torch.amp.autocast('cuda', enabled=True):\",\n      \"            logits = model(xb)\",\n      \"            adj = logits - TAU * log_priors[None, :]\",\n      \"        pred = adj.argmax(dim=1).int().cpu().numpy()\",\n      \"        s = done\",\n      \"        e = done + len(ids)\",\n      \"        preds_idx[s:e] = pred\",\n      \"        done = e\",\n      \"        if (it+1) % 300 == 0 or e == len(ds):\",\n      \"            print(f'Test infer progress: {e}/{len(ds)} elapsed={time.time()-t0:.1f}s', flush=True)\",\n      \"    # Map to category ids and write submission\",\n      \"    pred_cat = [idx2cat[int(i)] for i in preds_idx]\",\n      \"    sub = pd.DataFrame({'Id': test_df['Id'].values, 'Predicted': pred_cat}).sort_values('Id').reset_index(drop=True)\",\n      \"    sub.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)\",\n      \"    print('submission.csv written.
