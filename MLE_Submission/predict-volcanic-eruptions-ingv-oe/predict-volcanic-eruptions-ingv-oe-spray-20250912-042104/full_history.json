The initial step involves creating a markdown cell for the plan, and then I can request the expert feedback. But I can only use one tool per turn! So, I'll insert the markdown cell first, detailing the plan, including a starter code skeleton for loading data and outlining the basic EDA plan. Then, I'll request expert input in the next turn.**Formulating the Analysis Plan**\n\nI remember the competition uses three-component seismic timeseries for each segment. Each CSV contains 10 minutes of data with 600,000 values at a 100Hz sample rate. The target is time_to_eruption in seconds, and the evaluation metric is mean absolute error (MAE). My plan is to focus on baseline feature engineering with stats per channel, like mean, standard deviation, quantiles, and spectral features through FFT. I'll utilize XGBoost with KFold GroupKFold based on volcano ID. It seems the dataset groups by volcano and station, so I’ll inspect the train.csv for eruption_time details later.

(e.g., bandpowers in specific Hz ranges, spectral roll-off, spectral flatness, autocorr peaks, RMS energy ramps, zero-crossing rates, chunked trend slopes).

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Action plan to reach medal\n\nValidation\n- Use GroupKFold. Best proxies for groups (in order):\n  1) eruption/sequence/volcano/station IDs if provided in train.csv\n  2) else infer sequences: a new group when time_to_eruption increases (cumsum(diff>0))\n  3) else cluster/by file prefixes/series or station if any\n- 5 folds. Keep all preprocessing inside folds. Use 1 seed to lock baseline; add 2–4 more seeds for final ensemble.\n- Do not split adjacent segments from the same sequence across folds. Do not fit any scaler/filter globally.\n- CV↔LB: With correct grouping, gap ~3–10%. Plain KFold can overfit and gap 10–20%+.\n\nFeatures (high-signal, fast)\n- Preprocess per file/channel before features:\n  - Detrend (linear).\n  - High-pass 0.5–1 Hz (Butterworth 2–4 order) to remove drift/very low-freq noise.\n  - Handle NaNs: fill with 0; add %NaN per channel as feature if relevant.\n- Time-domain per channel:\n  - mean, std, min, max, p01/05/25/50/75/95/99, IQR, RMS, MAD, skew, kurtosis\n  - zero-crossing rate, line length, Hjorth (activity/mobility/complexity)\n- Multi-chunk evolution (10–20 equal chunks of the 10-min window):\n  - per-chunk mean/std/RMS; across-chunk stats (mean/std/min/max)\n  - slopes of chunk means/stds (linear fit), last–first deltas\n  - energy fraction in last K chunks; abs diff between consecutive chunks\n- Frequency (per channel; use Welch PSD preferred over raw FFT):\n  - log-bandpowers in ~[0.5–2, 2–4, 4–8, 8–16, 16–32, 32–64] Hz (adjust to Fs)\n  - spectral centroid, roll-off (85/95%), flatness, entropy\n  - dominant peak frequency and amplitude; high/low band energy ratios\n- Autocorr: peak lag/value in short lags (≤5 s); short vs long lag energy ratio\n- Cross-channel: Pearson correlations XY/YZ/XZ; optional: cross-corr peak lag/value\n- Aggregations: optionally mean/std across sensors to reduce dim if many channels\n- Denoising: a light median filter (e.g., k≈101 samples) before computing a subset of stats can help; skip wavelets initially for speed.\n\nPreprocessing/target/predictions\n- Don’t global-standardize raw signals. If you normalize, do robust per-file/channel (median/IQR) before feature extraction.\n- Scale the final feature matrix per fold using RobustScaler (or StandardScaler); tree models don’t need it but it can stabilize.\n- Target: keep in original units. log1p is mixed; default to no transform. If you test log1p, strictly inverse-transform and compare OOF MAE; keep whichever wins.\n- Clip predictions to [0, max_train_target].\n\nModels (fast medal)\n- Primary: XGBoost GPU. Secondary for diversity: CatBoost GPU. 1D-CNN only if you already have it ready; otherwise slower ROI.\n- XGBoost GPU starter (eval_metric=mae):\n  - tree_method: gpu_hist (or hist with device=cuda)\n  - max_depth: 7–8\n  - learning_rate: 0.03–0.05\n  - n_estimators: 2000–4000\n  - subsample: 0.7–0.8\n  - colsample_bytree: 0.6–0.8\n  - min_child_weight: 8–10\n  - reg_alpha: 0–6 (start 0.1–6), reg_lambda: 1–10 (start 5–6)\n  - early_stopping_rounds: 200–300\n- CatBoost GPU starter (loss=MAE):\n  - depth: 7, learning_rate: 0.03, iterations: 4000–6000\n  - l2_leaf_reg: 6, rsm: 0.7, bagging_temperature: 0.5\n  - od_wait: 300–400, task_type: GPU\n\nEfficiency\n- Smoke tests: 300–500 files, 2 folds. Then scale to full 5-fold.\n- Parallel feature extraction with joblib; read as float32; process per file to cap memory.\n- Cache train/test features to Parquet (float32). Cache OOF and fold models.\n- For 60k-length signals, split into 10–20 chunks for chunked features and Welch PSD; avoid per-sample DataFrames.\n\nEnsembling\n- Yes, small but real gains: +1–5% MAE typically.\n- Blend 2–4 XGB seeds + 1–2 CatBoost seeds. Weights ∝ 1/(OOF_MAE). Validate weights on OOF.\n\nExpected numbers\n- Bronze: OOF MAE ≈ 5.0e6 or slightly better.\n- Silver: OOF MAE ≈ 4.7–4.9e6 (strong feature set + GPU GBDT + light ensemble).\n- CV→LB gap: 3–10% with good grouping; larger if grouping is weak.\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid\n- Wrong CV (no grouping) → leakage and misleading CV.\n- Fitting scalers/filters outside folds.\n- Using filename/id/order as features.\n- Not handling NaNs; missingness itself can be a feature.\n- Non-determinism: fix seeds (numpy/random/xgb/cat), single GPU, stable libs.\n- Overly fine frequency grids causing overfit; keep band count modest and regularize.\n- Wasting time on wavelets/NNs before CV is solid.\n- CPU-only training when GPU is available.\n\nMinimal baseline (Bronze-ready; often Silver with tuning)\n- CV: GroupKFold(n_splits=5) using eruption/sequence/volcano/station; else infer by time_to_eruption increases.\n- Features per file/channel:\n  - detrend + high-pass 0.5–1 Hz; robust per-file scaling optional\n  - global stats: mean/std/min/max/p01/05/25/50/75/95/99/IQR/RMS/MAD/skew/kurt/ZCR/line-length/Hjorth\n  - chunks (10): per-chunk mean/std/RMS; across-chunk stats; slope of chunk means; last–first deltas; energy fraction last 3 chunks\n  - Welch PSD bandpowers: 0.5–2/2–4/4–8/8–16/16–32/32–64 Hz; centroid/roll-off95/flatness/entropy; peak freq/amp; high/low ratios\n  - autocorr peak lag/value (≤5 s); short/long lag energy ratio\n  - cross-channel Pearson XY/YZ/XZ\n- Model: XGB GPU with params above, early stop 200–300. Train 2–3 seeds. Optional CatBoost 1 seed.\n- Inference: average seeds/models; clip to [0, max_target]. Submit.\n\nNext steps for your notebook\n- Inspect train.csv for any group IDs; if none, build sequence groups via time_to_eruption jumps.\n- Implement feature extractor with caching; run 300–500-file 2-fold smoke CV.\n- Scale to full data 5-fold; train XGB 2–3 seeds; add one CatBoost; blend by OOF. Submit.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Execute a fast, leakage-safe, feature-based pipeline with log-target modeling, strong CV, and a small ensemble. Prioritize LightGBM baseline + XGBoost, then refine features and blend by OOF.\n\nPriorities (in order)\n- Data/schema lock: verify IDs, target name, file paths, channels, sampling rate, segment length.\n- Target transform: train on log1p(y); predict with expm1; bias-correct via OOF residual mean; clip to [0, P99.5].\n- Leakage-safe CV: 5-fold GroupKFold by any station/series/eruption group; else block by file/time; stratify on binned target if no groups; report stable fold MAE.\n- Baseline model: LightGBM (regression_l1) as primary; add XGBoost (reg:absoluteerror) for blend; early stopping.\n\nFeature extractor (fast, robust, per-channel, per-file)\n- Preprocess: detrend/mean-remove; robust scale per file (median/IQR); impute NaNs per file; add missingness/zero_fraction features.\n- Time domain: mean, std, min/max, q01/05/25/50/75/95/99, IQR, RMS, skew, kurtosis, zero-crossing rate.\n- Chunked trends: split into 10–20 chunks; for each, mean/std/abs-diff; summarize across chunks (mean, std, min, max, slope).\n- Frequency: Welch PSD bandpowers emphasizing low freq: 0.1–0.5, 0.5–1, 1–2, 2–4, 4–8, 8–16, 16–32 Hz; spectral centroid, roll-off, flatness, spectral entropy; dominant freq and amplitude.\n- Autocorr/periodicity: ACF at a few lags, first peak lag.\n- Cross-sensor: zero-lag corr and max abs cross-corr; optional PCA across sensors.\n- Keep 300–1000 features; cache to parquet; identical pipeline for train/test.\n\nModels and settings\n- LightGBM: objective=MAE; num_leaves≈64–128; feature_fraction≈0.8; bagging_fraction≈0.8; bagging_freq=1; min_data_in_leaf≈50; lr≈0.05; up to ~2000 rounds; early_stopping=100.\n- XGBoost: reg:absoluteerror; tree_method=hist; GPU if available; comparable rounds/early stopping.\n- Train 2–3 seeds per model; weight ensemble by inverse OOF MAE (e.g., 1/MAE^2). Ensure ensemble improves OOF.\n\nValidation alignment checks\n- No transform fit across folds; recompute scalers/imputers inside each fold.\n- Stable fold MAEs; investigate stations/series with poor residuals; consider per-station normalization or categorical station feature if available.\n- OOF vs LB sanity check with an early baseline submission.\n\nEfficiency musts\n- Parallel feature extraction (joblib/dask); chunked CSV reads; GPU verification.\n- Handle NaNs/Infs post-FFT; avoid global imputations; cache features and OOF to avoid recompute.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Random KFold on adjacent/related segments (leakage).\n- Skipping log1p target or not clipping predictions (tail blow-ups).\n- Using raw values without per-file normalization.\n- Too few features (only mean/std) or too many unvetted features; not handling flatlined/clipped sensors.\n- Submission schema/order mismatch.\n\nMilestones and targets\n- Day 0: Data schema confirmed; 200-file smoke test; cached features; 2-fold CV MAE on log scale; one early submission to check CV–LB gap.\n- Day 1: Full 5-fold OOF with LightGBM on log target; CV MAE (original scale) ≤ ~4.5–5.0M.\n- Day 1–2: Add PSD/entropy/cross-sensor/chunk slopes; train LGBM + XGB seeds; bias-correct + clip; ensemble OOF ≤ ~4.5M; submit.\n\nDeliverables checklist\n- train_features.parquet, test_features.parquet.\n- OOF predictions + fold MAEs; model configs.\n- submission.csv with exact ID/target names and order."

    "llm_json": "**Considering feature extraction**\n\nI need to implement feature extraction and a CV baseline. For this, I'll add code to create feature functions, but I only have segment_id and time_to_eruption, with no explicit group IDs. Experts suggested inferring sequences by grouping when time_to_eruption increases, but I wonder if this will hold up without the order mapping of segment files. Each training segment usually belongs to a specific volcano, and without clear grouping, it's tricky. I could try KFold while being cautious about leakage, but they stressed the importance of grouping. Hm...**Planning feature extraction**\n\nI can kick things off by caching feature extraction and conducting a smoke test on a small subset. First, I'll implement functions to read CSV files as float32, perform detrending, and apply high-pass filtering using scipy.signal, but I need to install scipy first. I'll utilize Welch from scipy.signal for efficient processing and leverage Joblib for parallel execution. I'll create a cell for package installations, ensuring scipy, joblib, scikit-learn, and xgboost are included. I should check imports before proceeding. Then, I’ll map segment_ids to file paths and compute the features, saving them to parquet. Let's get this done!**Setting up preprocessing and feature extraction**\n\nI'm ready to insert a code cell to define several things. First, I want to create safe_imports that will install packages if needed. Next, I’ll establish signal preprocessing functions, including detrending and applying a high-pass Butterworth filter at 1 Hz, considering that our sampling frequency (Fs) is around 100 Hz, which checks out since we have 60001 rows for 10 minutes. \n\nThen, I'll implement the compute_features_per_channel function for a numpy array and a compute_features_for_file function for reading the CSV. There’ll be a feature extraction loop with Joblib that saves to train_features.parquet and test_features.parquet, starting with a smoke test on the first 400 train IDs. I'll set the band edges as suggested and implement the logging as we go. Let’s write that code!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 2,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Feature extraction utilities and smoke feature build\",\n      \"import os, time, glob, math, gc\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"from typing import List, Dict, Tuple\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Ensure deps\",\n      \"def ensure_imports():\",\n      \"    import importlib, subprocess, sys\",\n      \"    def pip_install(pkg):\",\n      \"        print(f'Installing {pkg} ...');\",\n      \"        subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', pkg], check=True)\",\n      \"    for mod, pkg in [('scipy', 'scipy'), ('joblib', 'joblib'), ('sklearn', 'scikit-learn')]:\",\n      \"        try:\",\n      \"            importlib.import_module(mod)\",\n      \"        except ImportError:\",\n      \"            pip_install(pkg)\",\n      \"    # re-import after potential install\",\n      \"    global signal, welch, RobustScaler\",\n      \"    from scipy import signal\",\n      \"    from scipy.signal import welch\",\n      \"    from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler\",\n      \"\",\n      \"ensure_imports()\",\n      \"from joblib import Parallel, delayed\",\n      \"\",\n      \"RNG = np.random.default_rng(42)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Sampling rate detection from a probe file (assume constant across files)\",\n      \"probe_fp = sorted(glob.glob(str(TRAIN_DIR / '*.csv')))[0]\",\n      \"probe_n = len(pd.read_csv(probe_fp))\",\n      \"Fs = max(1, round((probe_n -

    "llm_json": "**Planning feature tests**\n\nI need to figure out the next steps for our smoke tests. It seems I want to finish the test features or proceed with modeling using existing train smoke features. Since I got interrupted during testing, reducing the test count to around 100 could help wrap things up quickly. I’ll modify cell 2 to set SMOKE_N smaller and think about adding progress logs per batch to track everything better, while also removing heavy computations like autocorrelation to speed things up. However, this might require rerunning train features, creating a potential mismatch issue with feature definitions.**Finalizing smoke tests**\n\nI think it’s better not to change functions and just reduce counts for the smoke tests. Since the train smoke is already built, I only need to finish the test features for 200. I can re-run the test part with smaller max_items. I’ll add a new cell to load the existing train_features_smoke.parquet, compute test features for 80 files, and then fit a quick model for predictions. However, the full submission needs all 444 test IDs, so I’ll need to plan for that future pipeline. Building group folds is tricky since we lack proper segmentation.**Setting up K-Fold for testing**\n\nI’m thinking of using KFold as a temporary method to establish a baseline, but I’m wary of leakage. To speed things up, I can do a 5-fold KFold shuffle and train XGBoost with GPU support. I don’t have torch installed, but XGBoost GPU uses CUDA, which should be fine. I’ll add a code cell to load train_features_smoke.parquet, merge it with train_meta for relevant segment IDs, and define features and targets. I’ll also implement early stopping and evaluate using OOF MAE. For the submission, I need predictions for the entire test set, but I could create a placeholder using the mean target for now.**Planning test feature extraction and modeling**\n\nI can compute test features for all 444, but it might be slow. It might be better to proceed with the training loop first and resume test feature extraction in parallel next time. Since our code runs serially, I think I’ll add the modeling cell now and execute it later. I’ll insert modeling code into cell 3 and include a function to create folds using KFold with shuffling.

Smoke features for 400 train; KFold(5) XGB GPU (xgb.train, esr=250, depth=8, lr=0.04, subsample=0.75, colsample=0.7, min_child_weight=9, reg 0.5/6) yields OOF MAE ~6.90e6 (likely optimistic/leaky due to no grouping).

Any robust way to avoid splitting adjacent segments across folds? - Feature triage for speed vs gain: should I drop autocorr for v1 full run to speed extraction, or are its gains material? Any must-have chunk features (slope of RMS, last-first deltas) to prioritize? Ideal nperseg for Welch at Fs~100 Hz to balance compute/signal? - Modeling tweaks: keep tree_method='hist' with device='cuda' or prefer 'gpu_hist'? Adjust max_depth/min_child_weight for full data?

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Validation (fix now)\n- Switch to GroupKFold immediately. Infer groups by sorting all train rows by time_to_eruption and starting a new group when it increases: groups = (train_meta.sort_values('time_to_eruption')['time_to_eruption'].diff().fillna(1) > 0).cumsum(). Merge back to features and use GroupKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=False, groups=groups).\n- Optional upgrade (if time): cluster files first (fast 10-chunk RMS fingerprint per file → KMeans ~20–30 clusters or mutual-NN graph), then apply the cumsum(diff>0) within each cluster to form groups. This reduces accidental cross-volcano leakage but is not required to get a medal.\n\nFeatures (triage for speed/gain)\n- Keep: detrend + high-pass (0.5–1 Hz), global stats, 10-chunk mean/std/RMS + slopes + last-first deltas, energy fraction in last 3 chunks, Welch bandpowers 0.5–48 Hz + centroid/rolloff95/flatness/entropy, cross-channel corr, NaN frac.\n- Drop for v1 full run: autocorr features (add back only if OOF improves >1–2%).\n- Welch: Fs≈100 Hz → nperseg=1024, noverlap=512, detrend='constant' (fast, good resolution). If time permits later, try nperseg=2048 to check OOF.\n- Prioritize any missing chunk features: per-chunk abs-diff volatility; ensure slopes/last-first for mean/std/RMS are present.\n\nModeling (XGBoost/CatBoost)\n- XGB params (start): tree_method='gpu_hist' (or keep hist + device='cuda' if stable), objective='reg:absoluteerror', eval_metric='mae', max_depth=8, min_child_weight=9–10, learning_rate=0.03–0.05, subsample=0.75, colsample_bytree=0.7, reg_alpha=0.5, reg_lambda=6, early_stopping_rounds=200–300, n_estimators 3000–6000.\n- Target: don’t log1p yet. Clip preds to [0, max_train].\n- Train 2–3 XGB seeds + 1 CatBoost GPU seed for diversity. CatBoost: loss_function=MAE, depth=7, lr=0.03, iterations=4000–6000, l2_leaf_reg≈6, rsm≈0.7, bagging_temperature≈0.5, od_wait≈300.\n- Blend by OOF-weighted average (e.g., weight ∝ 1/OOF_MAE). Refit each model on full train (with best_iterations) before test inference.\n\nExpected OOF (proper grouping, full data)\n- Single XGB: ~5.2e6–5.5e6 (Bronze range).\n- With 2–3 XGB seeds + 1 CatBoost: ~4.8e6–5.0e6 (Silver possible).\n- Your current ~6.9e6 with plain KFold will worsen to ~7–8e6 on smoke once grouped; don’t panic—optimize on full data.\n\nEfficiency and stability\n- n_jobs for extraction: 4–8 (match physical cores). Prevent oversubscription: set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1, MKL_NUM_THREADS=1, NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1.\n- Use float32 everywhere; handle NaNs/inf before filtering.\n- Prefer SOS filters for stability: butter(..., output='sos', btype='highpass', Wn=cutoff/nyq, order=3–4) + sosfiltfilt. Avoid very low cutoffs near 0 Hz. Beware filtfilt padlen/ram; parallelize at file level.\n- Cache features (parquet). Keep arrays, avoid per-sample DataFrame ops.\n\nConcrete next steps (in order)\n1) Build groups (global cumsum(diff>0)); save train_meta_with_groups.parquet. Wire GroupKFold into CV (no shuffle).\n2) Re-run smoke CV to sanity-check (expect higher MAE), then extract full train/test features with autocorr disabled; cache.\n3) Train 5-fold GroupKFold XGB (seed=42). Evaluate OOF; clip preds.\n4) Add 1–2 more XGB seeds + 1 CatBoost GPU; blend by OOF; refit on full train; predict test; clip; submit.\n5) If OOF >5.5e6, try: nperseg=2048, slight regularization bump (min_child_weight 10–12), add simple chunk volatility features, or try log1p vs. original (keep only if >2% OOF win).\n\nCode snippets\n- Grouping:\n  train_g = train_meta.sort_values('time_to_eruption').reset_index(drop=True)\n  train_g['group'] = (train_g['time_to_eruption'].diff().fillna(1) > 0).cumsum().astype(int)\n- XGB GPU switch:\n  params['tree_method'] = 'gpu_hist'  # or keep hist + device='cuda' if already working\n\nExecute this sequence; don’t proceed with more features/ensembles until GroupKFold is in place and full features are cached.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: prioritize full-data features, leakage-proof CV, and a small ensemble tuned for MAE.\n\nPriority actions (in order):\n1) Use all data end-to-end now\n- Extract features for all 3,987 train and all 444 test segments; cache to parquet. Parallelize (n_jobs ≥ 8). Trim heavy ops to finish fast: nperseg=512–1024 for Welch, 6–8 chunks, limit autocorr to ≤2–5 s, compute cross-sensor correlations as mean/max only.\n- Impute per-feature median; add missingness indicators (per-sensor nan_frac, active_sensors_count). Use float32.\n\n2) Fix validation to prevent leakage\n- Infer volcano groups and use GroupKFold (5 folds). Derive groups via KMeans on simple per-file aggregates (per-sensor mean/std/RMS and total energy, plus basic bandpowers); target-similarity/energy clustering works well. Keep groups intact across folds.\n- Track CV↔LB: if OOF << LB, you’re leaking; if OOF >> LB, increase regularization.\n\n3) Strengthen features (keep lean, add domain-critical signals)\n- Cross-sensor/global: mean/std/max of per-sensor stats; xcorr mean/std/max; PCA top-1/2 component stats.\n- Time-domain: RSAM at multi-scales (1s/10s/100s windows), ZCR, RMS, line length, Hjorth; chunk trends (mean/std/RMS slope and last–first deltas); rolling std/abs-slope over coarse windows.\n- Frequency-domain: Welch bandpowers emphasizing 0.5–4 Hz and 4–15 Hz; bandpower ratios (5–15/1–5; 15–40/(1–15)); spectral centroid/rolloff95/flatness/entropy; dominant peak freq/amp; PSD in low bands. Ensure consistent fs/params across train/test.\n- Sensor quality: features for fully-missing sensors; optionally impute a missing channel by mean of others and flag it.\n- Prune after a full run: drop bottom 20–30% by importance to reduce noise.\n\n4) Train 2–3 complementary models and blend\n- LightGBM (quantile, alpha=0.5) for MAE-like optimization: num_leaves ~ 127–255, feature_fraction ~ 0.7, bagging_fraction ~ 0.7–0.8, min_data_in_leaf 50–200, lr ~ 0.03. CPU/GPU both fine.\n- XGBoost (MAE): max_depth 6–8, min_child_weight 10–20, subsample/colsample 0.6–0.8, lr 0.03–0.05, 2–4k rounds, early stopping 200–300.\n- CatBoost (optional, strong on noisy tabs): train on sqrt(y+1) or log1p(y) and invert; use RMSE loss; it adds diversity.\n- Blending: average or weight by 1/OOF (or 1/OOF^2) across folds. Clip predictions to [0, max_train]. Non-negative only.\n\n5) Target handling\n- Baseline: native MAE (XGB) and quantile (LGBM). If CV is unstable, try log1p or sqrt transforms (remember to invert for eval/preds) for CatBoost or a second LGBM variant and include in blend.\n\n6) Efficiency and submission hygiene\n- Feature extraction first full pass should complete in ~1–2h after trimming; cache and reuse. Use joblib threads, batch I/O, and gc.\n- Ensure submission has exact columns and all 444 ids; integers OK; no NaNs.\n\nWhat to avoid\n- Random KFold on file-level (leakage across volcanoes/time). \n- Zero imputation without flags; per-feature medians + missingness features work better.\n- Overgrown feature sets without pruning. \n- Inconsistent DSP params between train/test.\n\nExpected outcome\n- With full data, grouped CV, lean but domain-focused features (RSAM, band ratios, low-frequency focus), and a small LGBM+XGB(+CatBoost) blend, OOF should reach ~3–5M. Stop when OOF ≤ ~5.0M and submit."

    "llm_json": "**Planning feature extraction steps**\n\nI’m figuring out the next steps for scaling features for full training and testing. We modified the extractor to drop acf and utilize SOS, and now I want to add a new cell for full feature extraction while managing thread limits and increasing n_jobs to about 8. I’ll also check if we can reuse existing smoke features and keep track of progress. My aim is to skip already existing files to save time, especially with Welch across multiple channels. Let’s insert this new cell!**Inserting a new processing cell**\n\nI could choose batch processing instead of parallel, but I'll move forward with inserting cell index 5. First, I'll set the environment threads to 1 and define the lists of IDs.
