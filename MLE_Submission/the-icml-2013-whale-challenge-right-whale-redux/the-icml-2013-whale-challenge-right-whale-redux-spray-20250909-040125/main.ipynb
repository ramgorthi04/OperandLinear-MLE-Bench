        "1) Setup & Data Discovery\n",
        "- Unzip train2.zip/test2.zip\n",
        "- Inspect contents and determine training/label files and test format\n",
        "- Identify metric (AUC) and submission format (sampleSubmission.csv)\n",

        "2) Baseline Modeling\n",
        "- If tabular: LightGBM/XGBoost baseline with KFold CV\n",
        "- If audio/images: check if features are provided; otherwise use available features (MFCCs/specs) if included; if raw media only, create a simple feature-extractor baseline\n",
        "- Log CV AUC; generate test predictions\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Iteration\n",
        "- Feature engineering (scaling, class weights, aggregates)\n",
        "- Model tuning (learning rate, depths, regularization)\n",
        "- Ensembling if multiple feature views exist\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Submission\n",
        "- Save submission.csv matching sample format\n",
        "- Iterate until CV strong; submit when confident\n",
        "\n",
        "Checkpoints for Expert Review:\n",
        "- After this plan\n",
        "- After data loading/discovery\n",
        "- After first baseline CV\n",
        "- If training is slow or CV poor"
