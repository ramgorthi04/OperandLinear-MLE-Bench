        "# Plan to Medal: NOMAD 2018 (formation_energy_ev_natom)\n",
        "\n",
        "Objectives:\n",
        "- Build a strong baseline quickly; iterate to medal.\n",
        "- Target: formation_energy_ev_natom. Metric: RMSLE (single target).\n",
        "\n",
        "Approach:\n",
        "1) Data loading + sanity checks\n",
        "- Read train.csv/test.csv; inspect target distribution and ID linkage to folders.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Fast, high-signal features (composition-driven, no heavy structure ML yet)\n",
        "- Parse each geometry.xyz to count elements {Al, Ga, In, O, N} and total atoms.\n",
        "- Compute composition fractions, simple chem descriptors via weighted averages:\n",
        "  atomic number, periodic row/group, Pauling electronegativity, atomic radius, valence electrons, first ionization energy, covalent radius.\n",
        "- Derived stats: mean/var/skew of descriptors over composition (weighted), entropy of composition, ratios (cation/anion fractions), and stoichiometry deviations from (Al_x Ga_y In_z)_{2N}O_{3N}.\n",
        "- Counts by species types (cation count = Al+Ga+In; anion count = O+N).\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Optional light structure geometry signals (cheap)\n",
        "- From xyz only (no lattice):\n",
        "  - Bounding box extents per axis, mean pairwise distance (sampled), min/max/median NN distance (fast KDTree), density-like proxy: atoms / bbox volume.\n",
        "  - These are optional; include if fast enough.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Modeling\n",
        "- LightGBM regressor with KFold (5 or 10 folds), robust params, early stopping.\n",
        "- Target transform: fit to y directly, use RMSLE in CV (or fit to log1p(y) and evaluate RMSLE on inverse).\n",
        "- Strong logging and timing per fold.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Submission\n",
        "- Train on full data with best params; predict test; write submission.csv matching sample format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iteration roadmap:\n",
        "- v1: Composition-only features + LGBM baseline.\n",
        "- v2: Add cheap geometry features.\n",
        "- v3: Tune LGBM (num_leaves, feature_fraction, min_data_in_leaf).\n",
        "- v4: Try CatBoost/ExtraTrees stack if time permits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Checkpoints requiring expert review:\n",
        "- After plan (now), after EDA/feature schema, after first CV result, before any heavy geometry computation, and before final submission."
