It's essential to separate these: the first part should be markdown for the plan, and the second part should remain a code cell for Python.

Let's move forward!**Crafting source lines for notebook**\n\nI’m thinking about how to set up the source lines properly for both markdown and code. For the markdown section, I’ll start with \"# Plan\" and include all relevant sections. Meanwhile, the code cell will contain just the Python code, omitting any plan comments at the beginning.

    "llm_json": "**Planning for macro-F1**\n\nI’m thinking about the macro-F1 score and how it requires per-class predictions. The default argmax is typically used, but macro-F1 doesn’t normally involve thresholding. I wonder about optimizing logit temperature per class, though that might not be necessary. Also, it might be helpful to ask if pretrained weights from INat or ImageNet are beneficial, especially for animal classes. I realize we need to unzip images, which we haven’t done yet. I plan to request an expert review with these questions and provide the filepath for the notebook.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Plan + quick data peek complete. Seeking guidance to lock a medal-grade strategy before heavy training. Context: 179k train rows, 14 classes, heavy imbalance (class 0 dominates; class 22 has 33 samples). Columns include file_name, location, seq_id, frame_num. GPU available (A10). Questions: 1) Validation: Should we use GroupKFold by seq_id or location to avoid leakage? Any recommended grouping hierarchy (seq_id > location) and number of folds/seeds that proved stable? 2) Targets: Any special handling for class 0 (empty/no-animal) typical in iWildCam? Recommended loss (focal vs label-smoothing CE), class weights, or sampling strategy for extreme imbalance? 3) Backbones and image size: Which pretrained backbones historically medal here? (timm models like tf_efficientnet_b3/b4, convnext_tiny/base, seresnext, or inat-pretrained weights). What input resolution (224/320/384) balances speed vs F1 on this dataset? 4) Augmentations: Minimal strong set that helped (RandomResizedCrop, ColorJitter, RandomErasing, Mixup/Cutmix ratios)? Use EMA? Any pitfalls with over-augmenting given camera trap domain? 5) Training schedule: Typical effective epochs, LR schedule (cosine + warmup), batch size, gradient accumulation. 6) Inference/TTA: Which TTA helped (hflip, five-crop) and at what weight? 7) Ensembling: Best simple blend approach to reach medal (different backbones/seeds/resolutions)? Save and average logits? 8) Metadata: Did adding metadata (location, time-of-day, seq context) via a small MLP head improve macro-F1? Recommended simple method to aggregate sequence frames at test time (majority vote across same seq_id)? 9) Any known gotchas: image preprocessing specifics (RGB vs BGR), handling of corrupt/missing images, resizing strategy, or label noise issues? Based on your answers, I will: unzip images, implement GroupKFold, build a fast timm baseline (likely convnext_tiny or efficientnet_b3 at 224), run a 1-fold smoke test with logging, then scale to full CV with OOF/test logits caching and iterate.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a concise, medal-focused recipe synthesized from all four audits, tailored to your setup and timeline.\n\n1) Validation (avoid leakage, mimic shift)\n- Primary CV: StratifiedGroupKFold with groups=location (5 folds, shuffle=True). This best mimics the region/domain shift while avoiding sequence/location leakage and keeps label balance.\n- If StratifiedGroupKFold isn’t available, GroupKFold(groups=location) and check fold label balance; or fallback to StratifiedGroupKFold(groups=seq_id). Location > seq_id as priority for final scoring fidelity.\n- Seeds: 2–3 seeds are enough. Track OOF per fold/seed.\n\n2) Targets/imbalance (class 0 dominates)\n- Batch balance: WeightedRandomSampler with per-class weight ∝ 1/sqrt(count); cap class 0 share ~25–35%. Oversample ultra-rare (e.g., class 22) 2–4x.\n- Loss: Balanced Softmax Cross-Entropy (with priors = class counts) is simple and robust. Alternative: Focal(gamma=2) + label smoothing 0.05 with class-balanced weights (effective number or 1/sqrt(count)). Don’t drop class 0; don’t let it dominate batches.\n- Optional: downweight class 0 in the loss slightly (e.g., x0.2) if OOF shows overprediction.\n\n3) Backbones and resolution\n- Start fast: convnext_tiny (in1k) @ 320. Strong add: tf_efficientnet_b3_ns @ 320; optional b4_ns @ 380 for a final boost.\n- iNat-pretrained weights help if available; use them if timm/environment permits.\n- Res sweet spot: 320. Use 224 for smoke tests only; 384/380 for the last strong model if time allows.\n\n4) Augmentations and EMA\n- Train augs (camera-trap friendly, moderate): RandomResizedCrop(scale ≈ 0.6–1.0), HorizontalFlip(0.5), ColorJitter(light: ~0.2/0.2/0.1/0.0), RandomErasing(p~0.2–0.5), Mixup(α~0.2) + CutMix(α~0.1–1.0). Avoid vertical flips, heavy rotations/perspective.\n- Use EMA (decay ~0.999–0.9998). It’s a cheap, consistent gain.\n\n5) Training schedule\n- Optimizer: AdamW; wd=0.02–0.05; betas=(0.9, 0.999).\n- LR: cosine with warmup 1–3 epochs; base LR 1e-3 for tiny/base, 7e-4–1e-3 for b3/b4; min_lr ~1e-6.\n- Epochs: 12–20 at 320 usually sufficient with sampler+EMA; early stop on val macro-F1 (patience 4–7).\n- Batch: as large as fits with AMP; use grad accumulation to reach effective batch ~128–256. Grad clip 1.0.\n\n6) Inference/TTA\n- TTA: horizontal flip only (2x). Optional: light multi-scale (e.g., 288 and 320). Five-crop typically doesn’t help here.\n- Average logits across TTAs.\n\n7) Ensembling\n- Save logits and average them (not softmaxed probs).\n- Blend across folds + 2–3 seeds + 2 backbones (convnext_tiny@320, tf_efficientnet_b3@320). Optional third: convnext_base@384 or effnet_b4@380.\n- Weight models by OOF macro-F1 (or equal if similar).\n\n8) Metadata and sequence context\n- Sequence aggregation: must-have. Average logits over frames sharing seq_id and assign to all frames. Mirror this inside each validation fold when computing OOF to keep CV honest.\n- Metadata: optional. Time-of-day features (sin/cos hour) and simple seq features can be concatenated via a small MLP head. Be cautious with location embedding (can overfit to train regions); only keep if location-grouped CV shows stable gains.\n\n9) Gotchas\n- RGB with ImageNet mean/std; PIL convert('RGB'). Handle corrupt images in a try/except (fallback or skip).\n- Resize: bicubic; for val/test use Resize to target size and center crop/pad (or square resize) consistently.\n- Monitor per-class OOF recall; if rares collapse, strengthen sampler or focal/weights slightly.\n- Cache OOF/test logits; keep exact fold indices to reproduce blends.\n\nImmediate next steps (adapt your notebook)\n- Switch CV to StratifiedGroupKFold(groups=location, n_splits=5).\n- Build baseline: convnext_tiny@320, BSCE (or Focal+LS 0.05), WeightedRandomSampler (1/sqrt counts; cap class 0), EMA on.\n- Smoke test: 1 fold, 2–3 epochs, verify OOF/TTA/seq-aggregation pipeline.\n- Scale: full 5-fold × 2 seeds. Save OOF/test logits per model.\n- Train second model: tf_efficientnet_b3_ns@320 with same recipe.\n- Inference: TTA(hflip), average logits across folds/seeds/models, then sequence-average logits, submit.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Fix pipeline and CV first, then train a long‑tail‑aware baseline with a two‑stage empty filter and sequence‑level smoothing; integrate iNaturalist via taxonomy mapping to cover unseen species; finish with TTA, per‑class thresholds, and a small ensemble.\n\nPrioritized plan (synthesizing best ideas from OpenAI > Claude/Grok):\n- Immediate triage (hour 0–2)\n  - Submission: exactly two cols [id, category_id]; id matches test.csv; output hard labels (not probs).\n  - Label mapping: category_id is non‑contiguous. Map model index -> original category_id via a sorted lookup; verify inverse mapping end‑to‑end.\n  - Sanity: submit a constant “empty” baseline (expect ~0.05–0.07 macro‑F1). Check your current submission’s label distribution (shouldn’t be >90% one class).\n  - Data IO: confirm images load correctly; color order; non‑corrupt.\n  - CV split: use GroupKFold by seq_id or location (no sequence leakage). Optimize macro‑F1 offline.\n\n- Strong, fast baseline (day 1)\n  - Backbone: convnext_tiny or tf_efficientnet_b3_ns at 320–384 px; AdamW + cosine; EMA; 10–15 epochs.\n  - Augs: RandomResizedCrop, HFlip, ColorJitter, p~0.2 Grayscale, RandomErasing; light Mixup 0.1 / CutMix 0.3.\n  - Imbalance: cap “empty” to ≤40% per batch; use either WeightedRandomSampler + CE with 0.05 label smoothing, or Class‑Balanced Focal (beta≈0.9999, gamma≈1.5). Track per‑class OOF F1.\n  - CV: 4–5 folds GroupKFold (seq_id or location). Save OOF logits.\n\n- Two‑stage pipeline (big lift for macro‑F1)\n  - Stage A: empty vs non‑empty binary classifier (balanced sampling).\n  - Stage B: multi‑class species classifier on non‑empty only (same backbone/augs/loss).\n  - Inference: if P(empty) ≥ t (t tuned on OOF for macro‑F1), output empty; else output Stage‑B class.\n\n- Sequence, TTA, and ensembling (free/cheap gains)\n  - Sequence smoothing: average logits across frames with same seq_id (after TTA).\n  - TTA: hflip + mild scale/crop jitter (5–10 views); average logits.\n  - Ensemble: 2–3 diverse models (convnext_tiny + effnet_b3 or ViT, different seeds/resolutions); OOF‑weighted blend.\n  - Thresholding: set per‑class decision thresholds on OOF to maximize macro‑F1.\n\n- External data and domain shift (critical per Claude/Grok)\n  - iNaturalist pretraining: pretrain on iNat 2017/2018; use the provided taxonomy mapping to align to competition classes; then fine‑tune on comp train.\n  - Optional adds: Caltech Camera Traps, AirSim synthetic for robustness.\n  - Domain adaptation: high‑confidence pseudo‑labels on test; test‑time BN adaptation; or light DANN/CORAL. Strong color/illumination augs and occasional grayscale help.\n  - Zero/few‑shot fallback: CLIP/OpenCLIP embeddings with text prompts/taxonomy and a linear head or nearest‑neighbor to catch unseen species.\n\n- Targets and checkpoints\n  - After triage + baseline: OOF macro‑F1 ~0.10–0.14; LB should track within ~0.01–0.02. If LB ≪ OOF, revisit mapping/submission/splits.\n  - With two‑stage + sequence + TTA + small ensemble: expect +0.01–0.03; aim ≥0.114 LB (bronze).\n  - With iNat pretraining/domain tweaks: push to silver range.\n\n- Pitfalls to avoid\n  - Label remap bugs; wrong id column/dtype; outputting probabilities.\n  - Random KFold/leakage across seq_id/location.\n  - Letting “empty” dominate batches; training with plain CE only.\n  - Using location/time as features (OK for grouping, not as inputs).\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n1) Fix mapping/submission and implement GroupKFold by seq_id/location; verify a constant “empty” baseline on LB.  \n2) Train convnext_tiny@384 with long‑tail handling (WeightedRandomSampler or CB‑Focal), strong augs, EMA; 4–5 folds; save OOF.  \n3) Add two‑stage empty filter; tune empty threshold on OOF for macro‑F1.  \n4) Apply sequence averaging, light TTA, and ensemble 2–3 diverse seeds/backbones; set per‑class thresholds on OOF.  \n5) Integrate iNaturalist: pretrain, map via taxonomy, fine‑tune; optionally pseudo‑label and light domain adaptation.  \n6) Iterate quickly; select by OOF macro‑F1; submit often. Aim OOF ≥0.12 and LB ≥0.114."

    "llm_json": "**Requesting expert advice**\n\nI’m thinking about requesting expert advice on next steps involving the two-stage empty detector, sequence averaging, TTA, and quick inference pipeline implementation. I’ll also ask about the differences between Balanced Softmax and Cross-Entropy loss. Meanwhile, I’m considering whether we can prepare the next cells while the training runs, even though it seems like we can edit the notebook during execution. However, it might be best to wait since we do need to save the model weights, which the current training cell doesn't do.**Planning model training and predictions**\n\nI need to modify or add code to save the model after each epoch and carry out validation predictions. While the training cell is running, I can prepare another cell to run inference on the validation and test sets using the current model variable. Once training is done, I could generate test predictions. For a baseline submission, I could train on all training data for one epoch to predict the test results. \n\nAlso, I need to ensure sequence averaging across test sequences and implement TTA with horizontal flipping and averaging logits.**Setting up inference and submission**\n\nI can insert a new cell for testing that builds the dataset using `val_tfms` and includes TTA with both normal and horizontal flip views. In this cell, I’ll run inference to get logits, average them, and sequence average the logits by `seq_id`. Then, I’ll apply argmax to model labels and map these to the original `category_id` using `idx2cat`. \n\nI’ll also ensure the `id` column matches the test rows and implement that in this new cell. Now, I need to establish TTA by applying the horizontal flip using `albumentations`, and our existing `val_tfms` already accounts for resize, normalization, and `ToTensorV2`.**Implementing TTA and DataLoader**\n\nFor TTA, I can manually create flipped images by using PyTorch to flip the tensor horizontally with `torch.flip(x, dims=[-1])`. This means I can keep both the original and the flipped images. I'll create a `TestDataset` that returns the image tensor, `id`, and `seq_id`. \n\nNext, I’ll set up the DataLoader for the test dataset with a batch size of about 64, and it’ll be beneficial to use automatic mixed precision (AMP). I need to implement sequence averaging by grouping by `seq_id`, which means I’ll fetch this from `test.csv` in a DataFrame.

Questions before heavy training: 1) Prioritization: Should we invest first in two-stage pipeline (empty vs non-empty then species) before full 5-fold training, or train a strong single-stage model first and add the empty filter later? 2) Loss: Do you recommend Balanced Softmax CE for this problem over LSCE/Focal given the extreme class 0 dominance? If yes, confirm a simple implementation approach (using priors from class counts inside CE). 3) Sampler policy: Our current sampler uses 1/sqrt(count) and 0.3x downweight for class 0. Is that reasonable, or would you cap batch share for class 0 (e.g., 30\\u201335%) via a custom sampler? 4) Schedule/epochs: For convnext_tiny@320 and effnet_b3_ns@320, what epoch counts would you set to hit diminishing returns quickly on an A10? (We plan 12\\u201315 epochs with EMA and cosine warmup.) 5) CV runtime strategy: To iterate faster, is training 3 folds \\u00d7 1 seed acceptable for the first model, then add remaining folds if OOF looks strong? 6) Sequence averaging: We implemented simple mean of logits across seq_id. Any better variant (median, weighted by confidence) that reliably improves macro-F1? 7) TTA: Keep only hflip, correct? Multi-scale not worth it here? 8) Ensembling plan sanity: convnext_tiny@320 + tf_efficientnet_b3_ns@320 (2\\u20133 seeds) with OOF-weighted logit averaging; later optional b4@380. Any better alternative under time constraints? 9) Quick pitfalls check: Any known label mapping gotchas for this comp (our category_id mapping uses sorted unique ids and round-trip idx2cat for submission). If all green, we will: implement a reusable train_fold() with EMA, early stopping on val macro-F1, checkpoint per fold; run convnext_tiny@320 for 5 folds (maybe 3 first), save OOF/test logits; then train tf_efficientnet_b3_ns@320; blend, sequence-average, and submit.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: You’re on a medal path. Here’s the synthesis of the best guidance from all reviews, tailored to your pipeline and 24h window.\n\nAnswers to your 9 questions:\n1) Prioritization: Train a strong single-stage first. Only add an empty/non-empty filter if OOF shows heavy empty confusion after ensembling (<~0.19 OOF).\n2) Loss: Use Balanced Softmax CE (logit adjustment with dataset priors) instead of Focal/LSCE. Implement by adding log(prior) to logits before CE. Do not combine BSCE with class weights; keep sampler moderate.\n3) Sampler: Your 1/sqrt(count) + downweight empty is fine. Ideally cap empty’s expected batch share to ~30–35% and give ultra-rares a floor (2–4x). Don’t overcomplicate if time is tight.\n4) Schedule/epochs: With EMA + cosine warmup, aim short, early-stop:\n   - convnext_tiny@320: 8–10 epochs (patience 4–5)\n   - tf_efficientnet_b3_ns@320: 10–12 epochs (patience 4–5)\n   Grad clip 1.0, effective batch ≥128 via accumulation if needed.\n5) CV runtime: Yes—3 folds × 1 seed first for each model. If 3-fold OOF (with seq-avg) is strong, expand to all 5 folds and/or add a second seed.\n6) Sequence averaging: Keep simple mean across seq_id and apply it in validation before computing macro-F1. Confidence-weighted mean (weights ≈ max_prob^2) is a small optional tweak.\n7) TTA: hflip only. Multi-scale isn’t worth the cost here.\n8) Ensembling: Your plan (convnext_tiny@320 + tf_efficientnet_b3_ns@320, 1–2 seeds) is solid. Average logits; OOF-weighted averaging is a small plus. Add b4@380 only if time remains.\n9) Label mapping: Your mapping is correct. Pitfall to avoid: compute CV metric after sequence averaging and ensure folds cover all classes.\n\nHigh-ROI upgrades to implement now:\n- Loss: Balanced Softmax CE\n  - Compute class_counts on full train (original distribution).\n  - priors = counts / sum; log_priors = log(priors+eps); use CE(logits + log_priors, target).\n  - Optional inference knob if empty overpredicted: logits += alpha*log_priors (alpha ~0.5–1.0) or a small negative bias to class 0.\n- Augs: Add Mixup (α≈0.2) and light CutMix (α≈0.5, p≈0.3). Use timm Mixup wrapper.\n- LR schedule: Cosine with 1–2 epoch warmup; min_lr ~1e-6. EMA decay ~0.9995–0.9997.\n- Validation: Return seq_id from the val dataset and compute macro-F1 after per-sequence averaging, not per-frame.\n- OOF/test saving: Save per-fold OOF and test logits for ensembling; mirror TTA + seq-avg in val.\n- Fold sanity: Your StratifiedGroupKFold by location produced very imbalanced fold sizes. Reseed and check per-fold class coverage; if still skewed, simple GroupKFold by location is acceptable (just ensure all classes appear in val).\n\nConcrete 24h plan:\n1) Patch training:\n   - Swap CE to BSCE (logit adjustment).\n   - Add Mixup/CutMix, cosine warmup, EMA, early stopping on val macro-F1 (with seq-avg).\n   - Cap empty’s expected batch share ~0.3–0.35; leave other weights ~1/√count with a rare-class floor.\n2) Train convnext_tiny@320:\n   - 3 folds × 8–10 epochs, save best by val macro-F1, save OOF/test logits.\n   - If 3-fold OOF ≥~0.18–0.19, extend to 5 folds or add a second seed (time permitting).\n3) Train tf_efficientnet_b3_ns@320:\n   - Same recipe, 3 folds first, then extend if strong.\n4) Ensemble:\n   - Average logits across folds/seeds/models (OOF-weighted if ready).\n   - Apply hflip TTA, then sequence-average, then submit.\n5) If empty is overpredicted on OOF:\n   - Add alpha*log_prior at inference (or small negative bias to class 0), re-score OOF, re-blend.\n6) Only if time remains and blend <~0.19 OOF:\n   - Consider a lightweight binary empty filter or a third small model (convnext_small@320) for diversity.\n\nThis keeps complexity low, maximizes ROI, and aligns CV with test.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: prioritize a clean baseline, fix the empty-class bug, train properly with imbalance-aware loss and EMA, then add light TTA, sequence averaging, calibration, and a small ensemble.\n\nImmediate fixes (highest impact)\n- Submit now to get a leaderboard baseline; verify submission format and label mapping round-trip.\n- Fix “empty” class mapping in sampler: use empty_idx = cat2idx[0], then downweight to 0.1–0.3. Your current idx2cat-based lookup is wrong.\n- Use EMA weights for validation and test inference (swap to EMA before evaluating/inferencing).\n- Guard against leakage: keep GroupCV by location; ensure no seq_id overlaps across folds.\n\nTraining plan (to lock silver, push gold)\n- Data/aug: 320–384 px; RandomResizedCrop(0.6–1.0), HFlip, mild ColorJitter; light RandomErasing/CoarseDropout. Avoid overly strong augs that hide small animals.\n- Imbalance: keep balanced sampler (≈1/sqrt(count)) with stronger empty downweight; try one of:\n  - Balanced Softmax (preferred for long tail), or\n  - Focal loss (γ=1–2) if minority recall lags, or\n  - CE + current sampler (after bug fix).\n- Optimization: AdamW, cosine schedule with warmup; label smoothing ~0.05; EMA on; grad clip; AMP. Batch 32–64.\n- Regimen: 5–10 epochs, Group 5-fold CV (or 3 folds × 2 seeds if time-limited). Early stop by macro-F1. Target OOF macro-F1 ≥ 0.18 to buffer LB drop.\n\nInference and calibration\n- Keep sequence-level averaging of logits (big gain).\n- TTA: hflip + 1–2 light scales (e.g., 0.9, 1.0, 1.1) and average.\n- Counter empty bias and long tail: logit adjustment by priors (subtract τ·log(prior)); tune τ on OOF to maximize macro-F1. If still overpredicting empty, add a small negative bias to empty logit.\n\nEnsembling (easy extra 0.02–0.04 F1)\n- Train 2–4 diverse models/seeds and average logits (OOF-weighted if available). Good mix:\n  - convnext_small/base @384\n  - efficientnet_b3/b4 or tf_efficientnetv2_s\n  - a small ViT (e.g., eva02_small or vit_s/b in21k/in22k)\n- Keep inputs/resolutions diverse for ensemble diversity.\n\nDomain-shift boosts (if needed for gold)\n- Pretraining: prefer in21k/in22k or iNaturalist-pretrained weights; fine-tune on competition data.\n- Pseudo-label high-confidence test images and retrain (iterate once).\n- Wildlife-specific augs: occasional blur/ISO noise/gamma/CLAHE to mimic motion and low light.\n- Detection-assisted crops (MegaDetector v5): classify detected animal crops (pad 10–20%); average with full-frame. Typically a large macro-F1 gain.\n\nMetadata (use cautiously)\n- Time-of-day features (hour/is_night) can help; avoid using location IDs as features (new locations at test).\n\nMonitoring and triage\n- If LB < 0.114 after first submit: recheck empty-class bug, use EMA at test, add logit adjustment, and consider Balanced Softmax.\n- If stuck near silver: add MixUp/CutMix (α 0.2–0.4), increase resolution to 384–448, and ensemble another backbone.\n- Keep an OOF confusion matrix; focus on rare-class recall.\n\nMinimal path to a medal\n1) Fix empty_idx, retrain convnext_tiny/small @384 for 4–6 epochs with EMA and current sampler.  \n2) Infer with EMA, hflip+light-scale TTA, sequence-avg, and tuned logit adjustment.  \n3) Submit; if marginal, switch to Balanced Softmax or add negative bias on empty.  \n4) Train a second model (e.g., effnet_b3 @384) and ensemble.  \n5) If chasing gold, add iNat/in21k/in22k-pretrained backbone and (time permitting) detector crops."

Currently, cell 8 is running training for 3 epochs, which is going to take some time—about 700 seconds per epoch based on previous records. I think it's beneficial to plan the next steps while this is running. I want to ensure I'm implementing the right inference processes, including loading EMA weights from the checkpoint for improved results. I also need to address a scheduling warning to ensure everything runs smoothly in the next phases.**Defining inference function**\n\nI want to create a new cell that defines a function for loading checkpoints, swapping to EMA, and running test inference with horizontal flipping. I'll include sequence averaging and saving the submission afterward. There’s also a need to apply prior logit adjustments at inference, keeping alpha at 1.0 or 0. I’ll add the code to load `convnext_tiny_fold0.pth` after training. To use EMA, I need to ensure I'm matching model parameters with the stored `ema_params` correctly. Lastly, I plan to compute test logits and save them as `test_logits_fold0.npy`.**Preparing to insert inference cell**\n\nI think it’s time to insert a new cell at index 9 for the inference function. Once the training is complete, I can execute this cell to run the inference process. It’s a good plan!

The task indicates I should only submit when I'm confident, but the target for a medal is above 0.114. With sequence averaging, my model likely exceeds that. Still, it seems reasonable to submit for a baseline leaderboard score while continuing to train. The coach's instruction suggests we should submit now for a baseline, but submitting might end the session. I guess I should submit and then iterate later.**Evaluating submission strategy**\n\nThe instruction tells me not to submit the final answer until I’m confident about achieving a medal. I think I’m likely above the 0.114 target, but I’m unsure about the leaderboard mapping from my F1 score of 0.44 on the validation. That score is quite high! The test leaderboard might be lower than expected, but previous thresholds suggest gold is around 0.212. I could submit now and keep training, but there’s a risk since it might end the tool. Alternatively, I could focus on adding more folds and train them in the background.**Planning the training process**\n\nI need to insert a cell to loop through folds 1 and 2 for training with 8 epochs each. Since I've already trained fold 0, I can skip it. With each epoch taking around 11.5 minutes, training two folds will take about 184 minutes, which is fine within a 24-hour window. After training, I should save the test logits for averaging and submission. I'll create a cell to train these folds, run inference, store the logits, and then blend them by averaging before writing the submission. I’ll wait to run inference until after both folds finish training.**Setting up multi-fold training**\n\nI want to add a new cell for orchestrating multi-fold training, inference, and blending. Since the training takes a while, I can have it run while I sleep. I’ll create cell 11 to outline this process:\n\nFirst, I'll define `folds_to_run` as [1,2]. Next, I'll loop through each fold to call the `train_one_fold` function with the appropriate parameters like epochs and batch size, which will save the best checkpoint. After training, I’ll use the `infer_test_and_save` function to save logits without overwriting the submission. I need to make sure the file names reflect the correct fold to avoid overwriting.**Implementing inference for multiple models**\n\nInstead of a complex setup, I could just load the model and run inference in the new cell while saving with different filenames. This makes it simpler! I can write code to load each checkpoint, gather logits, and then average them.\n\nI'll create a cell that does the following: for each fold in [0,1,2] with an existing checkpoint, I'll load the model and compute logits from the test loader, incorporating techniques like flip TTA. After that, I’ll average logits across models, do a sequence average, and map this to the submission.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the fastest path to a medal, distilled from all four audits and tailored to your current state.\n\nImmediate\n- Submit now: Submit the current 3-fold convnext_tiny@320 EMA+hflip+seq-avg blend to anchor LB.\n\nWhat to train next (GPU)\n- Backbone diversity first: Train tf_efficientnet_b3_ns@320 on folds 0–2 using your current recipe.\n  - Keep BSCE (+log_priors), WeightedRandomSampler (downweight empty), EMA, cosine+warmup, hflip TTA, seq-avg.\n  - Hyperparams: lr=7e-4 to 8e-4, wd=0.02–0.03, epochs 8–10 (early stop patience 3–4), ema_decay=0.9997, min_lr=1e-6. Batch as large as fits; use grad accum to reach effective batch ≥128 if needed.\n  - Augs: keep as is; optional tiny bump (e.g., CoarseDropout p~0.4) is fine.\n  - Mixup/CutMix: Only if you switch to CE(+label smoothing) instead of BSCE. Your BSCE implementation uses hard labels; adding mixup now risks hurting. Under time pressure, keep Mixup/CutMix OFF with BSCE.\n\nFold plan\n- Don’t train convnext_tiny folds 3–4 now. A diverse backbone will give more lift than more folds of the same model.\n- Folds imbalance: The current SGKF(groups=location) sizes are extremely uneven. For speed/compatibility, reuse the same folds 0–2 for b3 so you can ensemble quickly. If time remains later, prepare a 3-fold GroupKFold(groups=location, shuffle=True, random_state=42) for more balanced validation and compare; switch only if it clearly stabilizes OOF and you can retrain.\n\nBlending\n- Within a model: weight each fold’s logits by its fold OOF seq-avg F1 (normalize weights).\n- Across models: weight by each model’s mean OOF seq-avg F1; if similar, equal weights are fine.\n- Keep everything in logit space. Apply TTA and seq-avg before blending across models.\n\nPrior/logit adjustment\n- Add an optional alpha_prior to add alpha*log_priors to logits at inference (after TTA, before seq-avg). Tune alpha on blended OOF (grid: 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0). Apply only if it helps (often reduces empty overprediction).\n\nQuick-win postprocessing\n- Confidence-weighted seq-avg: weight each frame by max_softmax^2 when averaging per sequence; test on OOF first. Often a small gain.\n- Empty-class bias: if OOF shows empty is overpredicted, subtract a small bias from the empty logit or rely on alpha_prior. Otherwise skip.\n- Per-class thresholds and location-aware priors: skip for now (low ROI/risk of overfit).\n\nValidation/folds\n- Location-grouped CV is correct. The extreme size imbalance can destabilize OOF, but rebuilding now costs time and breaks comparability. Reuse existing folds for b3; evaluate a balanced 3-fold GroupKFold only if you still have hours left.\n\n20-hour plan\n- Hour 0–1: Submit your current 3-fold convnext_tiny blend. Add alpha_prior knob and confidence-weighted seq-avg in your infer/ensemble code (toggleable).\n- Hours 1–9: Train tf_efficientnet_b3_ns@320 on folds 0–2 with BSCE+EMA.\n- Hours 9–11: Ensemble convnext_tiny (f0–2) + b3 (f0–2) with OOF-weighted logits; try alpha_prior grid on OOF; pick best for test. Submit.\n- Hours 11–18: If time, add a second seed (preferably for convnext_tiny or b3 on folds 0–2) and re-ensemble. Alternatively, start training the remaining folds only if GPU hours remain.\n- Hours 18–20: Final blend with all checkpoints, OOF-weighted across folds/models, with best alpha_prior and confidence-weighted seq-avg. Submit final.\n\nKey do’s and don’ts\n- Do: Anchor LB now; prioritize b3 diversity; use OOF-weighted blending; keep BSCE+EMA; hflip TTA; seq-avg; optional alpha_prior tuning.\n- Don’t: Spend time on convnext folds 3–4 before adding diversity; introduce Mixup/CutMix with BSCE; add complex location priors.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Submit your current 3-fold convnext_tiny EMA + hflip TTA + sequence-averaged ensemble now to lock a baseline (OOF suggests silver/gold). Then add diversity, finish folds, and calibrate.\n\nPrioritized plan\n- Now\n  - Submit the 3-fold EMA+hflip+seq-avg blend.\n  - Fix BSCE priors: compute log_priors on the training split of each fold and align with your sampling. Either:\n    - Compute priors from the effective sampling weights per class, or\n    - Drop the WeightedRandomSampler and rely on Balanced Softmax (or Logit-Adjusted CE). Don’t mix mismatched priors with a sampler.\n- Next 1–2 days\n  - Complete convnext_tiny across all 5 folds (or rebalance to 3 folds with GroupKFold by location if current 5-fold split remains highly uneven). Always validate with sequence-averaged logits and prevent sequence/location leakage.\n  - Train a second backbone for the same folds: tf_efficientnet_b3_ns@320 (6–10 epochs, EMA=0.9996, AdamW+cosine+warmup, grad clip, same augs). Optional: 1–2 extra seeds and a short 320→384 fine-tune for diversity.\n  - Ensemble at logit level: average within backbone, then weighted blend across backbones using OOF sequence-avg F1 to pick weights. Keep blending at logit level, not softmax.\n  - Calibrate: fit a single global temperature T on OOF (after seq-avg) and apply at test. Optional small prior adjustment alpha tuned on OOF.\n- If LB stalls\n  - Minimal TTA beyond hflip (only if OOF proves gains): add small rotations or a 320/384 multi-scale, 2–4 views max.\n  - Pseudo-labeling: add high-confidence test sequences to training to adapt to domain shift.\n  - Class-tail focus: if OOF shows near-zero F1 for rare classes, try focal loss instead of BSCE or a two-stage empty vs non-empty gate (keep empty recall high).\n  - Optional metadata fusion: late-fuse location and time-of-day features via a small MLP head if allowed; proceed only if OOF gain is clear.\n  - Specialist splits: day/night experts or mean+max sequence logit fusion (e.g., 0.7 mean + 0.3 max) tuned on OOF.\n\nMust-have settings (keep consistent)\n- Data/augs: 320 px; RandomResizedCrop, hflip, light brightness/contrast, CoarseDropout; avoid strong hue shifts (hurts IR/night).\n- Optimization: AdamW, cosine with warmup, EMA=0.9996, mixed precision, gradient clip, 6–10 epochs with early stop on OOF macro-F1.\n- Inference: EMA weights, hflip TTA, sequence-level logit averaging by seq_id, correct empty-class mapping.\n\nEnsembling and weighting\n- Hierarchical: average folds per backbone → blend backbones by OOF-weighted logits. Optionally refine weights per location cluster if you see consistent fold-specific generalization differences.\n- Keep models diverse (convnext_tiny + tf_efficientnet_b3_ns + extra seed/res) rather than many similar ones.\n\nEfficiency quick wins\n- Increase inference batch size, use mixed precision and torch.compile, cache datasets/transforms to disk, pin versions to avoid dep churn.\n\nPitfalls to avoid\n- Leakage across locations/sequences; validating per-image instead of per-sequence.\n- Mismatched priors with a sampler; computing priors on full data or including val split.\n- Over-downweighting the empty class; heavy color augs; excessive TTA with no OOF gain.\n- Not using EMA at eval/inference; resolution inconsistency across models; wrong class-id mapping.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Submit your current 3-fold ensemble now.\n- Train remaining convnext_tiny folds; train tf_efficientnet_b3_ns on the same folds.\n- Align BSCE priors to the training split (and sampler) or drop the sampler.\n- Ensemble by OOF-weighted logits; apply a single temperature from OOF; keep hflip TTA + seq-avg.\n- If needed, add seeds/384 fine-tune, minimal extra TTA, and pseudo-labeling."
