The plan is to create an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook. I’ll check for available files and inspect the metadata JSON to see where the images are, especially since the directories show no files.\n\nI think it's also important to check the sample_submission.csv format. I'll add the planning and markdown note before executing the code cells. Then, I’ll confirm a fast baseline plan with a pretrained model like ConvNeXtV2 or EfficientNet.**Planning the analysis**\n\nI’m considering using the classes and labels from train_metadata.json, along with a macro-F1 metric. I’m leaning toward a hierarchical taxonomy, but starting with a strong CNN as a baseline feels right. Right now, my focus is on creating a planning document and checking the environment.\n\nSo, I’ll add two cells: one for the markdown plan and another for checking the GPU and inspecting the dataset. Since the tool allows only one cell per turn, I’ll insert the markdown plan first, then add the code in the next turn.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 0,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Herbarium 2022 - FGVC9: Plan and Milestones\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Objective: WIN A MEDAL (macro F1 on LB).\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Milestone 0: Environment & Data Sanity\",\n      \"- Verify GPU availability (nvidia-smi, torch cuda).\",\n      \"- Inspect metadata: train/test sizes, class count (taxonID), label distribution skew, per-institution/site info.\",\n      \"- Confirm image paths exist and are readable.\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Milestone 1: Validation Protocol\",\n      \"- Stratified KFold by taxonID (e.g., 5 folds).\",\n      \"- Deterministic seed handling, consistent folds cached.\",\n      \"- Track macro-F1 OOF (primary) and accuracy.\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Milestone 2: Fast Baseline\",\n      \"- Model: timm pretrained CNN (e.g., convnext_base/large or eva02 base) with mixed precision.\",\n      \"- Image size 384 (warm-up at 224 for smoke tests), aug: RandAug/AutoAug + ColorJitter + Mixup/CutMix (light).\",\n      \"- Loss: LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy or FocalLoss; try both (OOF-driven).\",\n      \"- Optimizer: AdamW; OneCycle or cosine schedule; EMA weights.\",\n      \"- Class weights or re-weighting (long tail) vs. sampling; validate.\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Milestone 3: Speed/Scale-up\",\n      \"- Progressive resizing: 224 -> 384 -> 448 if time.\",\n      \"- Use fp16, channels_last, torch.compile(optional).\",\n      \"- Enable efficient dataloading: prefetch, pin_memory, num_workers, jpeg-turbo if available.\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Milestone 4: Error Analysis & Iteration\",\n      \"- OOF error buckets: by family/genus, institution/source, size, orientation.\",\n      \"- Try hierarchical soft targets (family/genus smoothing) if time.\",\n      \"- Try stronger backbones (beit/beitv2, convnextv2, efficientnetv2).\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Milestone 5: Ensembling\",\n      \"- Blend diverse seeds/models/resolutions by logits avg.\",\n      \"- Calibrate if needed (temperature on OOF).\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Milestone 6: Submission\",\n      \"- Generate test predictions and save submission.csv.\",\n      \"- Verify shape and ids align with sample_submission.csv.\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Checkpoints for Expert Review\",\n      \"- After Env+Data sanity (M0).\",\n      \"- After baseline OOF ready (M2).\",\n      \"- After any major iteration/ensemble (M4/M5).\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Next Cell (to add):\",\n      \"- Environment checks, file listings, metadata inspection, class counts, and quick integrity assertions.\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"markdown\"\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Added a concise planning markdown cell outlining milestones and when to request expert reviews.

I'll execute this task one tool at a time, and since the last turn involved markdown, I'll add a code cell at index 1. I’ll include commands like nvidia-smi, parse JSONs, and print counts to prepare for predictions. It's essential to verify the label space and inspect image counts as we move forward. This helps establish a baseline for our predictions.**Preparing code cell tasks**\n\nI’m planning to add a code cell that will do several things. First, I’ll print the output of nvidia-smi to check CUDA availability, since I might need to install Torch later. Then, I’ll list the files and load train_metadata.json and test_metadata.json. I also want to print the number of training images and classes.

Since there are many classes with just a few images, margin adjustments will be important. I wonder if I should also train with image center crops? For herbarium sheets, I should consider specific augmentations as well. It might be a good idea to request an expert review on all these strategies!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Milestone 0 complete: Environment and data sanity verified.

Metadata fields: images[file_name,image_id], annotations[category_id,genus_id,institution_id], categories (taxonomy), plus a distances matrix is present in train_metadata.json. Images exist within nested subdirs. Submission requires mapping test image_id -> predicted category_id.\\n\\nRequesting medal-focused guidance on the following before building the baseline:\\n1) Validation: For long-tail herbarium sheets, should we use stratified KFold by category_id (5 folds) or GroupKFold by institution_id to mirror domain shift? Any standard fold protocol from medal solutions?\\n2) Architecture: What backbones worked best here under time constraints: convnextv2_base/large, efficientnetv2_l, beit/beitv2, eva02? Recommended input size and progressive resizing plan (e.g., 224->384)?\\n3) Loss and sampling: For 15.5k-class long tail, should we prefer class-balanced focal loss, ASL, LDAM+DRW, balanced softmax, or CB reweighting? Sampler choice: class-balanced sampler vs plain random with mixup/cutmix? Any pitfalls with herbarium sheets (e.g., cutmix harming text/labels)?\\n4) Use of provided artifacts: How to exploit train_metadata['distances'] and taxonomy (genera/family) effectively? E.g., hierarchical label smoothing, taxonomic soft targets, margin scaling, or post-processing corrections? Any proven recipe?\\n5) Augmentations: For flat mounted herbarium sheets, what augmentations give gains without hurting: RandAug/AutoAug, random perspective, color jitter, grayscale, cutout? Any text/label regions to be careful with?\\n6) Inference: TTA (e.g., 4-8 flips/crops) worth it? kNN-on-embeddings ensemble vs softmax-only? Temperature scaling recommended?\\n7) Efficiency: With 665k images and 24GB GPU, what batch size and epochs are realistic to hit bronze/silver within hours? Suggested training schedule (cosine + warmup, EMA)?\\n8) Ensembling: If time permits, what minimal diverse ensemble (2-3 seeds/models) historically pushed to medal zone? How to combine (logits avg, kNN blend)?\\n9) Data pitfalls: Any leakage or mismatch to avoid (e.g., same specimen across institutions, duplicate sheets, filename patterns)? Any critical preprocessing choices for herbarium images (resize strategy, padding)?\\n\\nGoal: lock a robust, efficient baseline plan (single strong model first) that can reach at least bronze quickly, then iterate.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a synthesized, medal-focused plan that reconciles the strongest points from all four reviews, with concrete settings you can drop into your baseline. The goal: a single strong model to reach bronze quickly, then two quick pushes (taxonomy/distances + a small ensemble) toward silver.\n\nDecisions (answers to your 9 questions)\n1) Validation\n- Use 5-fold StratifiedKFold by category_id for model selection and OOF macro-F1.\n- Optional secondary check: one GroupKFold by institution_id (80/20) only to monitor domain shift; do not select models by this.\n- Cache fold assignments; ensure every class appears in each fold (iterative stratification if needed).\n\n2) Architecture (+ input size)\n- Baseline: timm convnextv2_base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k, num_classes=15501.\n- Input: 384. Optional warm start: 0.3 epoch at 224 then 384.\n- Diversity for ensemble (if time): efficientnetv2_l_in21k or eva02_base_patch14_224.mim_in22k (train at 384).\n\n3) Loss and sampling (long tail)\n- Safe, fast baseline (no sampler): Balanced Softmax Cross-Entropy (logit-adjusted CE using class priors). No mixup/cutmix with this.\n- Alternative (if you’ll use distances): Soft targets from distances + standard CE (or SoftTargetCE). In that case you can keep random sampling; WeightedRandomSampler is optional (can help but may destabilize with mixup).\n- Avoid CutMix on herbarium sheets. Mixup only if using SoftTargetCE (alpha=0.2).\n\n4) Use of taxonomy and distances (when you have baseline OOF)\n- Step 1 (easy, robust): add an auxiliary genus head on the penultimate features; loss = 1.0*CE_species + 0.2*CE_genus.\n- Step 2 (bigger gain): distance-aware soft labels. For each class c, build soft targets via softmax(-dist[c]/T), T≈4.0, then train with CE on soft targets (replaces label smoothing).\n- Light hierarchical smoothing fallback (if distances wiring is slow): 0.7 to target, 0.2 spread over same-genus classes, 0.1 to others.\n\n5) Augmentations (herbarium-safe)\n- Train: RandomResizedCrop(384, scale=(0.85,1.0), ratio=(0.75,1.33)); HorizontalFlip p=0.5; RandAug/TrivialAug (n=2, m≈7–9); ColorJitter (0.2,0.2,0.2,0.1); RandomErasing p=0.25 small-area, const.\n- Avoid: CutMix; heavy perspective/affine; grayscale. Vertical flips are risky (orientation cues from labels) — skip for baseline.\n\n6) Inference\n- Use EMA weights. TTA: 2–4 views (orig + hflip; optionally ±5% scale). Average logits across TTA and folds.\n- kNN/prototype blending: good later step; not needed for first submission.\n- Temperature scaling: optional; small effect on macro-F1.\n\n7) Efficiency (A10 24GB realistic plan)\n- Mixed precision (amp), channels_last, cudnn.benchmark=True, pin_memory, persistent_workers=True, num_workers=8–12.\n- Batch at 384: 48–64 in fp16 (use grad accumulation to reach effective batch 256 if needed).\n- Epochs: 5–8 for a solid bronze; cosine schedule with 1 epoch warmup; EMA decay ~0.999–0.9999.\n- Optimizer: AdamW lr=3e-4 (scale with effective batch), wd=0.05, betas=(0.9,0.999).\n\n8) Ensembling (minimal, high ROI)\n- 2–3 models: convnextv2_base_384 (seed 42), efficientnetv2_l_384 (seed 42), and/or eva02_base_384 (seed 42). Optionally add a second seed for convnextv2_base.\n- Combine by logits average (after TTA). If you add prototypes later, blend 0.7 logits + 0.3 prototype similarity.\n\n9) Data pitfalls / preprocessing\n- Preserve original category_id mapping; train on remapped [0..C-1] but map back for submission. Use image_id joins; file_name may repeat.\n- Aspect-preserving: RandomResizedCrop for train; at test, resize shorter side to 384 then center-crop (or pad-to-square, then center-crop). Don’t squish.\n- Catch corrupt images in the loader; skip them. No filename/institution leakage features.\n\nConcrete baseline you can run now (single strong model)\n- Folds: 5-fold StratifiedKFold by category_id, seed=42; track OOF macro-F1.\n- Model: timm.create_model('convnextv2_base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k', pretrained=True, num_classes=15501)\n- Input: 384 (optional 0.3 epoch at 224 warmup).\n- Aug: RRC(384, scale 0.85–1.0, ratio 0.75–1.33) + HFlip 0.5 + RandAug(n=2,m=7–9) + ColorJitter(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.1) + RandomErasing p=0.25.

If using SoftTargetCE, Mixup alpha=0.2 is OK.\n- Loss (pick one clean path):\n  A) Balanced Softmax CE (with class priors from train counts), no mixup, random sampling.\n  B) SoftTarget CE with distance-derived soft labels (T=4.0), random sampling; optional auxiliary genus head (weight 0.2).\n- Optim: AdamW lr=3e-4, wd=0.05, betas=(0.9,0.999); cosine to 1e-6; warmup 1 epoch.\n- EMA: decay 0.999–0.9999 (start after warmup).\n- Batch: 48–64 at 384 fp16; use grad accumulation to reach eff_bs ≈256 if VRAM tight.\n- Training length: 6–8 epochs total (expect ~1–2 h/epoch on A10 given IO); save best by OOF macro-F1 per fold.\n- Inference: EMA weights, 2x TTA (orig + hflip) to start; logits averaged across folds; argmax to category_id; build submission image_id->category_id.\n\nIteration path to silver (after baseline OOF)\n- Add auxiliary genus head (+0.01–0.02 F1 typical).\n- Switch to distance-aware soft targets (or add as a variant model).\n- Train a second diverse backbone (efficientnetv2_l or eva02_base) at 384; ensemble logits; add 4x TTA.\n\nNotes on disagreements across reviews and why these choices\n- StratifiedKFold is the common, stable protocol for macro-F1; GroupKFold is useful only as a secondary stress test.\n- ConvNeXtV2_base at 384 is the best speed/accuracy tradeoff on A10; EfficientNetV2_L or EVA02_base add diversity for the ensemble.\n- Balanced Softmax CE is the simplest robust long-tail fix without sampler complications; distance-based soft targets are a strong, proven upgrade once the baseline runs.\n- Avoid CutMix on herbarium; keep augments moderate; skip vertical flips for safety.\n\nIf you want minimal PyTorch snippets for Balanced Softmax CE and the genus auxiliary head, say the word and I’ll drop paste-ready code.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Execute a retrieval-first baseline today, then add one strong fine-tuned model with explicit long-tail handling and light hierarchical priors. Validate with macro-F1, iterate fast, and ensemble.\n\nPriority plan (do this now)\n- Build the training table correctly\n  - Join train_metadata[\"images\"] with train_metadata[\"annotations\"] on image_id. Label = category_id. Keep cat_id_to_idx and idx_to_cat_id maps.\n  - Paths: train_images/<file_name>, test_images/<file_name>. Test Id equals image_id from test_metadata; follow sample_submission order.\n- Retrieval baseline (fast, high ROI)\n  - Extract embeddings: OpenCLIP ViT-L/14 336px, fp16, channels_last. L2-normalize features. Cache train/test embeddings.\n  - FAISS (GPU) index with inner product/cosine. kNN top-k (k=20–50). Predict via similarity-weighted neighbor votes; optionally convert to probs.\n  - TTA for retrieval: 3–5 crops per image; average features before kNN.\n  - Class prototypes: per-class mean embedding. If kNN confidence low, blend with nearest prototype.\n  - Submit. Target holdout macro-F1 ≥0.5; often enough for bronze on this task once blended.\n\nThen secure the medal\n- Fine-tune one strong classifier (blend with retrieval)\n  - Start: convnext_base (IN21k→IN1k or v2) or beitv2_base at 384px. If holdout <0.5, scale up (convnext_large or Swin/BEiT-L).\n  - Augs: RandomResizedCrop(384, scale 0.85–1.0), HFlip, light ColorJitter. Keep Mixup/CutMix ≤0.2 or off initially.\n  - Long-tail loss/sampling: use WeightedRandomSampler with inverse sqrt freq OR Balanced Softmax/CB-Focal (gamma≈2). Label smoothing 0.05 if not using focal.\n  - Optimizer/schedule: AdamW (lr 1e-4–3e-4, wd 0.05), cosine with warmup; AMP + EMA. Train 1–3 epochs first; save best by val macro-F1.\n  - Inference: light TTA (flips + 5-crop); average logits.\n  - Blend: tune α on holdout to blend classifier logits with retrieval votes (+0.05–0.10 macro-F1 typical).\n- Add hierarchy (cheap but effective)\n  - Build genus/family maps from categories/genus_id.\n  - Post-process: if top species is inconsistent with predicted genus, rerank within that genus. Or smooth probs by genus prior.\n  - If time: multi-task heads (family/genus/species) with small auxiliary loss.\n\nValidation and iteration\n- Start with a single stratified holdout by category_id (fast). Track macro-F1 only. Report per-genus buckets to find weak groups.\n- After baseline is stable, consider 3–5 fold StratifiedKFold by category_id for final models.\n- Submit after each major milestone to gauge LB/OOF correlation.\n\nEnsembling for headroom\n- If time permits, train one diverse model (e.g., efficientnetv2_m or ViT-B/Swin-B at 384–448). Average logits (weight by OOF). Keep retrieval in the final blend.\n- Temperature-scale logits on holdout for calibration.\n\nSpeed and reliability\n- Use A10 24GB fully: bs 32–64 at 384px, fp16, channels_last. DataLoader num_workers 8–16, pin_memory, prefetch_factor>2.\n- Don’t start at 512px. Scale up only if OOF plateaus.\n\nQuality checks (avoid 0.00s and drops)\n- Map back to original category_id before writing submission. Ensure prediction count equals sample rows and row order matches sample_submission Id.\n- Never use micro metrics; use macro-F1. Avoid random splits without stratification.\n- Avoid overly strong aug (especially heavy Mixup/CutMix) that hurts rare-class F1.\n- Use metadata['file_name'] (nested paths) not ad-hoc directory logic.\n\nTargets and decision gates\n- Today: retrieval kNN with TTA → holdout macro-F1 ≥0.5; make a valid submission.\n- Next: single fine-tuned model + retrieval blend → holdout ≥0.60; submit.\n- If <0.5 after first fine-tune: switch to a larger backbone (convnext_large or Swin/BEiT-L), increase res to 448, and strengthen long-tail handling (CB-Focal/LDAM/logit adjustment).\n- For stability: keep iterative submissions and monitor OOF→LB correlation."

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Bottom line: get a safe retrieval submission now, then spend the bulk of the remaining time training a single strong classifier. Use quick, high-ROI tweaks on retrieval (GPU search, TTA, prior debias, prototype blend). If you want one more retrieval boost without heavy compute, add a linear probe. Do NOT burn hours re-extracting ViT-L/14 before you’ve started the classifier.\n\nDirect answers\n1) ViT choice\n- Keep the ViT-B/32 run for v1. Do not switch to ViT-L/14 next unless you have spare time after starting the classifier. The ROI of L/14 extraction is smaller than the ROI of training a ConvNeXtV2_base classifier.\n- If you absolutely stay retrieval-only, then L/14@336 is the best upgrade.\n\n2) kNN params\n- k in 32–96; 50–64 is a good default.\n- Add long-tail debiasing in the vote: divide each class score by (class_freq[c]^alpha), alpha=0.3–0.5 (0.5 is a safe start). Equivalent: add −alpha*log π_c to class scores.\n- Optional: temperature weights on neighbor sims: weights = softmax(sim/τ), τ≈0.05–0.1.\n\n3) TTA for retrieval\n- Use 2 views: original + hflip. L2-normalize each, average, then re-normalize before search. Skip 5-crop; low ROI here.\n\n4) Prototype blend\n- Yes. Start at 0.6–0.7 kNN + 0.4–0.3 prototype-cosine. Scale prototype cosine (e.g., multiply by 10–20 or softmax both before mixing). Tune quickly on a held-out slice if possible.\n\n5) FAISS choice\n- Switch to GPU search. Use faiss GpuIndexFlatIP (float16 vectors if needed). This cuts 174k×665k search to minutes.\n- If faiss-gpu install is painful, do torch.mm on GPU in chunks (normalize, fp16, chunk size 2k–8k) and torch.topk.\n\n6) Submission ordering\n- Your approach is correct: Id = row index, matching test_metadata order. Just don’t reorder test_df.\n\n7) What to do next (fastest path to bronze/silver)\n- Priority A (now): finish B/32 v1. Add quick retrieval upgrades before v2:\n  - 2× TTA, class-prior debias, GPU search, prototype blend. Keep k=64, alpha=0.5.\n- Priority B (immediately in parallel/next): train a single ConvNeXtV2_base @384 with Balanced Softmax CE. This is your biggest jump toward silver.\n  - Recipe: timm convnextv2_base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k, num_classes=15501; AdamW lr=3e-4 wd=0.05; 6–8 epochs cosine; fp16; EMA 0.9999; aug: RandomResizedCrop(384, 0.85–1.0), HFlip 0.5, light RandAug, avoid CutMix. 5-fold stratified OOF if you can, otherwise 1 strong split + OOF log.\n  - Optional +0.02–0.03: add auxiliary genus head with small weight.\n- Priority C (quick extra without re-extraction): train a linear probe on top of your existing CLIP train embeddings (e.g., L2-normalized 512-d → 15501 softmax). Trains in <1–2h and often beats raw kNN; then blend with kNN/prototypes.\n- Blending for v2/v3: 0.7 classifier + 0.2 kNN + 0.1 prototype (tune 0.6/0.3/0.1 if needed). Add 2–4× TTA at classifier inference for a small bump.\n\nMinimal timeline (23.7h)\n- 0–3h: Let B/32 finish; implement TTA + prior debias + GPU FAISS + prototype; submit v1→v2.\n- 0–1h (in parallel): Set up stratified folds and the ConvNeXtV2 pipeline.\n- 3–10h: Train ConvNeXtV2_base@384 (6–8 epochs). Save best by val macro-F1.\n- 10–12h: Inference with 2–4× TTA; blend with retrieval/prototypes; submit v3 (bronze+).\n- If time remains: train linear probe on CLIP embeddings and blend; or start a second lightweight model for ensemble.\n\nKey implementation notes\n- Always L2-normalize embeddings. For retrieval voting, clamp negatives or use softmax(sim/τ).\n- Use fp16 for storage/search to save VRAM and speed.\n- Validate OOF macro-F1 to guide blending/params.\n- Keep a clean mapping between y indices and category_id for all blends.\n\nThis plan combines the quick retrieval gains with the classifier that moves you into medal range.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Pivot off CLIP-B/32 + CPU kNN. Build a fast, competitive baseline from stronger embeddings + GPU scoring, then train fine-grained image classifiers and ensemble.\n\nImmediate pivot (fast path to bronze — best from OpenAI)\n- Stronger embeddings\n  - Use OpenCLIP ViT-L/14 (laion2b_s32b_b82k) or EVA02-L/14. Extract 2–4 TTA views (center + random resized crop/flip/±10–15° rot), L2-normalize features before averaging.\n- Classification without kNN\n  - Prototypes: mean L2-normalized train features per class; L2-normalize prototype matrix P (15501×D). Predict via cosine logits = E_test @ P^T with torch.mm on GPU in chunks.\n  - Linear probe: train a single nn.Linear(D, 15501) on frozen train features for 2–5 epochs.\n    - Loss: cross-entropy with label smoothing 0.05–0.1 + class-balanced weights (e.g., 1/sqrt(freq) or “effective number”).\n    - Optim: AdamW, cosine LR with warmup, large batches (8k–32k feats/step), AMP.\n    - Optional: temperature-scale using a small holdout.\n  - Ensemble: average logits from prototype and linear-probe (and TTA).\n- Easy boosts\n  - Near-duplicates: if max cosine to any train feat > 0.99, copy that label.\n  - Genus gating: score top-K genera first (e.g., K=5), then restrict species scoring to those genera.\n- Engineering\n  - Avoid CPU FAISS; use GPU matmul. Ensure features are L2-normalized. Verify submission mapping: Id = 0..N-1 row order; Predicted = category_id.\n\nMedal push (silver/gold) via image fine-tuning — best from Claude (plus OpenAI alignment)\n- Backbones (ranked): ConvNeXt-L/XL, EVA-02 Large, BEiT-v2 Large, Swin-v2 Large, EfficientNetV2-L, ViT-L (MAE). Start at 224, then fine-tune 384/448 (512 if time).\n- Augmentation (fine-grained, keep moderate)\n  - RandAug/AutoAug, light ColorJitter, RandomResizedCrop (preserve aspect), HFlip, light rotations, MixUp α=0.2–0.4 + CutMix α=1.0, Random Erasing.\n- Long-tail handling (critical for macro-F1)\n  - Sampler: class-balanced or repeat sampling (e.g., 1/sqrt(freq)).\n  - Loss: Class-Balanced (effective number), LDAM-DRW or Balanced Softmax; Focal/Asymmetric can help; add label smoothing.\n  - Decoupled head: train backbone normally; then re-train classifier head with balanced sampling/adjusted loss.\n- Hierarchy/metadata\n  - Multi-task heads (species + genus) or hierarchical losses/soft targets; genus consistency regularization.\n  - Institution/domain cues: consider per-domain BN or light domain adaptation.\n- Optimization/infra\n  - AdamW wd≈0.05; LR 1e-3 to 5e-4 (scale with batch), cosine schedule with warmup, AMP, gradient clipping, EMA; channels_last; efficient dataloading.\n- Validation/inference\n  - Stratified 3–5-fold by category_id; track macro-F1 OOF.\n  - TTA (flips, crops, small rotations). Ensemble diverse archs/resolutions/seeds; weight by OOF; optional temperature calibration.\n\nPitfalls to avoid (both coaches)\n- CPU kNN at full scale; weak ViT-B/32 embeddings; ignoring long-tail; over-strong color jitter/cropping that removes margins; naive oversampling; wrong submission mapping; not L2-normalizing for cosine; no proper stratified validation; memory blow-ups from large FC layers (monitor).\n\nActionable execution order\n1) Today: Swap to ViT-L/14 or EVA02-L/14 features + 2–4 view TTA; build class prototypes; GPU cosine classification; submit.\n2) Next: Train linear probe on features; ensemble with prototypes; add near-dup override + genus gating; resubmit.\n3) Then: Train 1–2 strong image models (ConvNeXt-L, EVA-02 L) with the long-tail + hierarchical recipe; fine-tune at 384/448; TTA; 3–5-fold; blend all logits for final submission.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-28 21:08:39] Cell 5 in `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb` has been executing for 376s and is still executing.

After that, it will execute a CPU-based kNN, which could take a long time due to its size. I’m considering interrupting after the embeddings are finished to add a GPU search with debiasing. However, if I interrupt now, I might stop the saving process. It may be best to let it finish before avoiding the CPU kNN.**Choosing an action**\n\nI need to make a decision about the next steps. It seems like I should let the embeddings finish before interrupting to prevent any loss, especially since it’s at 96% completion. I can sleep for about 30 seconds, which gives me enough time, and then interrupt before the kNN process starts. After that, I plan to implement a GPU cosine search with debiasing and write the submission. It’s tricky since I can only either sleep or interrupt right now, but it’s better to wait and let it finish first.**Sleeping briefly**\n\nI’ve decided to sleep for 0.6 minutes. This short wait should give the embeddings a moment to finish processing before I interrupt the kNN. It feels like a good plan since I want to avoid complications from interrupting mid-saving. Just a little pause, and then I'll be ready to proceed with the next steps!

    "llm_json": "**Planning efficient execution**\n\nI see that Cell 5 is running a kNN search using CPU FAISS, which will take a long time for the 174k x 665k dataset. I should interrupt it before it takes too long. Then I'll create a new cell to run a GPU-based search with a focus on debiasing and prototype blending using torch.mm or faiss-gpu, though right now I only have faiss-cpu installed. I'll interrupt the current process and later load the embeddings for a GPU cosine search.**Evaluating computation efficiency**\n\nI can compute class prototypes from the training embeddings by averaging them per class, but I need to be cautious about memory usage. The size is 665k x 512 float32, that's around 1.36 GB, which is manageable. The prototypes will be around 31.7 MB. However, calculating cosine logits between test and prototype embeddings is massive: 1.37 trillion operations, which is too heavy for the A10. Instead, I might try using kNN with chunks of test embeddings. But this approach brings its own challenges since that's still a huge number of operations. A faster solution would be to use faiss GPU with IVF/PQ, but it isn't installed.**Assessing complexity and solutions**\n\nThe expert suggested using torch.mm in chunks, but the complexity remains quite heavy. For a dot product of 2k x 665k with 512 dimensions, we’re looking at about 681 billion operations per chunk—way too high. Even with the A10’s performance capabilities, this still feels overwhelming. FAISS GPU would be a better option since it has optimized search structures. While FAISS CPU could work with an IVF index, it might be slow, especially considering the extensive operations required for indexing and searching. Interrupting and implementing FAISS GPU seems like the way to go.**Preparing to install faiss-gpu**\n\nI need to install faiss-gpu, ensuring I choose the right version for CUDA 12. The faiss-gpu 1.8.0 package supports it, and its wheels are named faiss-gpu-cu12, which is good to know. While I already have faiss-cpu installed, I can add faiss-gpu too, but there might be conflicts. First, I’ll need to interrupt the current notebook cell to proceed with the installation since I can’t do that while it’s running. I’ll use an action to interrupt the notebook, passing in the appropriate index.**Planning GPU search implementation**\n\nIn the next step, I’ll need to add a cell to run the GPU search and install faiss-gpu if it’s not already present. If needed, I can fall back on an approximate approach using torch.mm and topk selections over shards. However, I can’t escape the heavy compute of full dot products to all training data. So, I’ll aim to use a FAISS GPU IVF index for approximation, which will help manage the load. The plan is clear: interrupt the current process, install faiss-gpu, and add code for using GPU with GpuIndexIVFFlat.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"execute_code\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"code_execution_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"interrupt\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 5\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Interrupting cell 5 to prevent extremely slow CPU kNN (IndexFlatIP over 665k x 174k).

    "llm_json": "**Planning faiss installation and search**\n\nI’m thinking about creating a cell to install faiss-gpu-cu12 and set up a code cell for running GPU searches with GpuIndexFlatIP or IVF. Since we're limited to one action per turn, I’ll first insert a code cell for installing faiss. Then I’ll handle the search in another turn. I believe I can install using pip in Python and then import faiss. For the cell, I’ll ensure it checks for and installs the package, loads the embeddings, and sets everything up.**Addressing GPU memory usage and debiasing**\n\nI’m considering that faiss stores data in GPU memory, and with 1.36GB available, it seems doable. For search tests, I might try batching since faiss.search can handle it, but passing all at once is also possible. Since 174k x 512 float32 fits, that should work. However, to be safe, I’ll go for batching. \n\nFor the debiasing task, I’ll implement class frequencies and compute normalized priors. Our current kNN voting could be more efficient with numpy vectorization, especially given the number of samples. Accumulating results may need a new strategy for performance.**Finding efficient classification methods**\n\nI’m realizing that using np.add.at with a preallocated array is impractical due to the immense memory requirement with num_classes being 15,501 and N at 174,052 leading to around 2.69 billion floats. A per-sample loop with pandas groupby per row seems inefficient too.\n\nInstead, I’m thinking about using prototype classification. By averaging training embeddings for each class, I could create a prototype matrix of about 31MB. This would allow me to perform GPU matrix multiplication for class scores efficiently, using chunks and calculating only the top1 logits to keep memory usage manageable, particularly on an A10.**Implementing prototype classification**\n\nI’ve decided that using the prototype method is better for classification and makes debiasing easier since I can simply subtract alpha times log prior directly from the logits. Following expert advice, the plan is to add a cell that computes class prototypes from the training embeddings and their respective labels.\n\nI'll aggregate the average normalized features for each class using numpy, then create a prior vector for the counts divided by total. For scoring, logits will be calculated from the test features and debiased before determining the final categorical IDs. I can skip the faiss GPU for this approach, which feels more streamlined!**Preparing code cell for execution**\n\nI’m getting ready to add code cell 6, where I’ll load the train and test embeddings from .npy files. The plan includes building prototypes using float32 and L2 normalization with an alpha value set to 0.5.\n\nI want to perform chunked GPU matrix multiplication using half precision. I’ll move the prototypes and log_prior to the torch device as torch.float16, normalized. Then, I’ll process the test data in chunks, convert them to torch.float16 tensors, compute the logits, apply debiasing, and collect predictions before writing to submission.csv. I’ll also add timing logs and possibly set the chunk size to 4096.

Still, I might request expert review at a milestone just to be safe before proceeding.**Establishing a scoring baseline**\n\nI'm realizing that the system likely grades submissions, and I need to aim for at least above the median score. The CLIP-B/32 prototypes might perform decently, possibly around >0.4 macro-F1, which could net a bronze medal, but that’s hard to predict. I think the safest approach is to submit now to get a baseline score and then iterate from there. The auto-grader scores immediately, so it’s essential to establish that baseline and ensure the pipeline functions correctly. I’ll go ahead and submit_final_answer.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"submit_final_answer\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Baseline retrieval-prototype submission.csv has been generated successfully using OpenCLIP ViT-B/32 embeddings with class-prior debiasing.

    "llm_json": "**Planning classifier training**\n\nI’m considering our next action because we need to improve after receiving no medal. Experts suggested training the ConvNeXtV2_base classifier and enhancing retrieval with TTA and possibly a linear probe. The first step is to set up the classifier training pipeline, which may involve creating a new notebook or adding cells. Implementing dataset augmentations and a training loop with stratified K-fold could lead to quicker results. Starting with 1-2 epochs might give us some lift, while also tweaking retrieval with TTA averaging for both train and test embeddings.**Optimizing embedding extraction**\n\nI need to consider re-running the extraction process, which took about 7.5 minutes for the training set and 2 minutes for the testing set. Doubling the time for a 2-view run would be around 19 minutes, which is manageable for a quick boost. I think we can add a cell for TTA embeddings with flipping and averaging by modifying the `extract_embeddings` function. It might be simpler to create a dataset version yielding both the original and flipped images. But I should also keep the classifier pipeline option in mind.**Planning TTA extraction and classifier setup**\n\nTraining is going to take hours, but since we have the time, I’ll tackle both tasks. I’ll start the TTA extraction now, which will take about 20 minutes, allowing for an improved submission. Then, I'll set up the classifier code. I need to implement a new cell to extract CLIP embeddings with two views: the original image and its horizontal flip for both training and testing. I'll save these to `embeddings/train_vitb32_tta2.npy`, compute average normalized features, and renormalize them. Afterward, I’ll adjust the prototype classifier to use these new paths and tune parameters.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 7,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Re-extract OpenCLIP embeddings with 2x TTA (orig + hflip), average and L2-normalize\",\n      \"import time, math, numpy as np, torch, json\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"from PIL import Image, ImageOps, ImageFile\",\n      \"import open_clip\",\n      \"ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True\",\n      \"\",\n      \"class TTADataset(Dataset):\",\n      \"    def __init__(self, df, preprocess):\",\n      \"        self.df = df.reset_index(drop=True)\",\n      \"        self.preprocess = preprocess\",\n      \"    def __len__(self): return len(self.df)\",\n      \"    def __getitem__(self, i):\",\n      \"        p = self.df.at[i, 'path']\",\n      \"        try:\",\n      \"            img = Image.open(p).convert('RGB')\",\n      \"        except Exception:\",\n      \"            img = Image.new('RGB', (224,224), (0,0,0))\",\n      \"        img_flip = ImageOps.mirror(img)\",\n      \"        return self.preprocess(img), self.preprocess(img_flip), i\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def extract_embeddings_tta2(df, model_name='ViT-B-32', pretrained='laion2b_s34b_b79k', bs=256, num_workers=12, out_path='embeddings/train_vitb32_tta2.npy'):\",\n      \"    device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\",\n      \"    print(f'Loading open_clip model {model_name} / {pretrained}', flush=True)\",\n      \"    model, _, preprocess = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms(model_name, pretrained=pretrained, device=device)\",\n      \"    model.eval();

While it’s running, I could request expert advice or plan next steps. \n\nIt's probably a good idea to set up a structure for classifier training once TTA completes. Alternatively, I might consider running a linear probe on existing embeddings for quicker improvement and could use a PyTorch linear layer for training.**Planning linear probe training**\n\nI’m thinking that training could happen quickly in about 2-3 epochs since the features are fixed and manageable. The memory requirements would be around 1.36GB for samples and about 0.7MB for labels, which is feasible with 440GB of CPU RAM. I can train on a GPU by loading batches from NumPy as torch tensors.\n\nI’ll plan to add a cell for training the linear probe with class-balanced weighting and maybe use Balanced Softmax. I'll prepare this now, so it can execute after the TTA finishes.**Setting up cell 8 for training**\n\nWe’ll execute the new cell after TTA finishes, which will allow us to choose the embeddings we want to use. \n\nIn cell 8, I’ll implement the following steps: load training data, define a dataset for yielding batches with optional balanced sampling, and calculate class weights for loss function. For the model, I’m thinking of using a simple linear model with AdamW optimizer. I’ll set training to run for 2 epochs on a GPU, using half precision to save memory. After training, I’ll perform inference on the test features and prepare the submission file.**Exploring submission blending options**\n\nI’m considering blending the average logits with the linear output, but it might be better to keep them separate. Creating a blended submission isn’t straightforward because it requires mapping.\n\nWe can't store a full matrix in memory, so it might be effective to compute per-class scores instead. I can generate linear logits for chunks and add the earlier computed cosine logits. I’ll use blend weights, setting the logit prototype at 0.3 and the linear weight at 0.7. We can compute prototypes for the training embeddings directly in the cell.**Implementing inference computations**\n\nAt inference, I’ll compute both the logits for the linear model and the prototype. For the linear logits, it’s the standard matrix multiplication with the weights and bias. Then, for the prototype logits, I’ll use the computed prototypes.\n\nI’ll account for debiasing each by subtracting an alpha log value. The blended output will combine both logits, with a 0.7 weight on the linear logits and a 0.3 weight on the prototype. For memory, I’ll ensure the chunk size is manageable, setting it at 2048 for safety, and add parameters to choose the embedding path in the new cell.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 8,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Linear probe on CLIP embeddings + prototype blend (fast, GPU, chunked)\",\n      \"import os, time, math, numpy as np, pandas as pd, torch, torch.nn as nn\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def pick_emb(path_tta, path_base):\",\n      \"    return path_tta if os.path.exists(path_tta) else path_base\",\n      \"\",\n      \"train_emb_path = pick_emb('embeddings/train_vitb32_tta2.npy','embeddings/train_vitb32.npy')\",\n      \"test_emb_path  = pick_emb('embeddings/test_vitb32_tta2.npy', 'embeddings/test_vitb32.npy')\",\n      \"print('Using embeddings:', train_emb_path, ' / ', test_emb_path, flush=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Load features\",\n      \"E_tr = np.load(train_emb_path).astype('float32')\",\n      \"E_te = np.load(test_emb_path).astype('float32')\",\n      \"y_tr = train_df['y'].to_numpy()\",\n      \"num_classes = int(y_tr.max()+1);

I wonder if I should ask for suggestions on whether to stop processing after TTA train extraction. Hm, actually, it seems like we should let it finish the extraction. I think that’s the better approach! Let’s keep moving forward with it.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Context: We built a retrieval baseline with OpenCLIP ViT-B/32 embeddings and a fast prototype cosine classifier with class-prior debiasing (alpha=0.5). First submission succeeded but no medal. We\\u2019re now running 2x TTA (orig+hflip) embeddings for train/test (Cell 7). It\\u2019s ~94% through train (627,200/665,720 written) and will then process test and run prototype again to overwrite submission.csv. Next, Cell 8 is prepared to train a linear probe (nn.Linear) on top of the TTA embeddings with class-balanced weights and blend 0.7 linear + 0.3 prototype (with debias). Ask: 1) Should we let the 2x TTA finish or interrupt and switch to a stronger plan? If proceeding, are the blend weights (0.7/0.3) and proto_scale=10 reasonable, and is alpha=0.5 a good default for this long-tail? 2) Main medal path: training a full image classifier. Please propose a concrete, time-feasible recipe on a single A10 24GB to reach at least bronze/silver: - Architecture and resolution: e.g., convnextv2_base or large, input size 384 or 448, channels_last, amp, EMA. - Loss for long-tail: ASL (additive margin + focal), focal with class-balanced weighting, or label smoothing/focal hybrid? If ASL, recommended params. - Sampler vs reweighting: class-balanced sampler, repeat factor sampling, or reweight losses? - Augmentations: RandAug/AutoAug, Mixup/CutMix values for long-tail and herbarium images; any color/contrast specifics that help. - Optim and schedule: AdamW, cosine w/ warmup; recommended lr, wd, epochs and realistic wall-clock on A10. - CV protocol: 5-fold stratified by category_id? Any grouping (institution_id) to prevent leakage? Save folds once. - Inference: TTA strategy (#flips/crops) and logit temperature. 3) Ensembling/Blending: Best practice to blend the classifier with our CLIP-based prototype/linear-probe. Suggested weights or temperature calibration on OOF; whether to add a KNN head on train features from the classifier backbone. 4) Retrieval upgrade: Is it worth extracting OpenCLIP ViT-L/14@336 or ViT-bigG features within our time budget? Any trick like PCA+FAISS IVF-PQ on GPU for kNN to improve retrieval\\u2019s contribution quickly? 5) Any Herbarium-specific tricks (hierarchical smoothing by genus/family using provided metadata, distances matrix usage) that historically moved the needle in this competition? 6) Guardrails: Potential pitfalls with memory/time on A10; recommended batch sizes; expected training time per epoch for convnextv2_base at 384; when to stop early. Goal: actionable steps we can execute immediately after Cell 7 finishes (then run Cell 8), and spin up the classifier training in parallel to chase a medal.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the shortest path to a medal, synthesizing all four audits and matching your current notebook/state.\n\n1) Current TTA job and blend\n- Let 2x TTA finish. Then run Cell 8 as-is.\n- Weights: 0.7 linear + 0.3 proto is fine; proto_scale=10–12 is safe.\n- Debias alpha=0.5 is a good default for this long tail.\n- Do this now for a safer v2 while you start the classifier in parallel.\n\n2) Main medal path: one strong classifier on A10 24GB\n- Model/res/setup\n  - timm: convnextv2_base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k, img size 384, pretrained=True, num_classes=15501.\n  - channels_last, AMP (fp16), cudnn.benchmark=True, EMA decay=0.9998–0.9999.\n  - Batch 48–64 (fp16). If OOM, 32 + grad accumulation to eff_bs≈256.\n- Loss for long-tail (pick one; start with the simplest that works fast)\n  - Balanced Softmax / Logit-Adjusted CE: add log(prior) to logits (or subtract log-prior from loss). No sampler needed.\n  - If you have 1–2 hours more: soft targets from distances: target = softmax(−dist[c]/T) with T≈4, or mix 0.8 one-hot + 0.2 soft; train with soft CE/KL.\n- Sampler vs reweight\n  - Use random sampling (no special sampler). If needed, class weights ~1/sqrt(freq) as a fallback.\n- Augmentations (herbarium-safe)\n  - RandomResizedCrop(384, scale=(0.85,1.0), ratio=(0.75,1.33))\n  - HorizontalFlip(0.5)\n  - RandAug or TrivialAugmentWide (light) + ColorJitter(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.1)\n  - RandomErasing(0.2–0.25, small area)\n  - Avoid CutMix; Mixup only if SoftTargetCE (then alpha≈0.2).\n- Optim/schedule\n  - AdamW lr=3e-4, wd=0.05, betas=(0.9,0.999)\n  - Cosine decay with 1 epoch warmup to lr=3e-4, eta_min≈1e-6\n  - Epochs: 6–8 (≈1–1.5 h/epoch). Save EMA-best by val macro-F1.\n- CV protocol\n  - Build and cache 5-fold StratifiedKFold by category_id (seed=42).\n  - For time, train 1 strong fold (≈80/20) first. If time remains, add folds.\n  - Institution grouping optional for monitoring; not required.\n- Inference/TTA\n  - Use EMA weights. TTA 2x (orig+hflip) or 4x (±5% scale). Average logits. Temp=1.0.\n\n3) Blending/ensembling\n- Start: 0.8 classifier + 0.2 retrieval (your best of linear+proto).\n- If keeping both retrieval heads: 0.7 classifier + 0.2 linear + 0.1 proto (alpha=0.5, proto_scale≈12).\n- If you can, calibrate a single temperature per head on OOF and do a tiny grid on weights.\n- Optional quick lift: KNN on classifier backbone features (L2-normalized, cosine, k=32–64), convert neighbor votes to class scores, blend at 0.1–0.2. Use GPU torch.mm/topk or FAISS IndexFlatIP on GPU.\n\n4) Retrieval upgrades\n- Skip ViT-L/14 now; ROI < classifier. Only do if GPU would be idle.\n- PCA+IVF-PQ is unnecessary for the current plan; simple GPU cosine search/chunked topk is enough if you add the KNN head.\n\n5) Herbarium-specific boosts\n- Auxiliary genus head (low-code, good ROI): loss = 1.0 species CE + 0.2 genus CE.\n- Distance-based soft labels (from metadata ‘distances’): p = softmax(−dist[c]/T), T≈4, or mix 0.8 one-hot + 0.2 soft. Adds meaningful +F1.\n\n6) Guardrails (A10)\n- Memory/time: convnextv2_base@384 fits bs 48–64 fp16; final linear over 15.5k classes is the memory peak—use grad accumulation if needed.\n- DataLoader: num_workers 8–12, pin_memory, persistent_workers=True; catch decode errors.\n- Time: ~1–1.5 h/epoch. Stop if val macro-F1 stalls 2 epochs (but 6–8 total is fine).\n\nImmediate actions\n- Now: Let Cell 7 finish. Run Cell 8 (0.7/0.3 blend, alpha=0.5, proto_scale≈10–12). Submit v2.\n- In parallel: Start classifier training per recipe above (convnextv2_base@384, Balanced Softmax or soft targets, AdamW + cosine, EMA). Train 6–8 epochs on one strong split.\n- After training: Inference with 2x–4x TTA; blend with retrieval (0.8/0.2). If time, add genus head or KNN head; resubmit.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: fix submission wiring immediately, then pivot from retrieval-only to a strong end-to-end classifier and blend it with your best retrieval head; use OOF-validated long-tail and hierarchical techniques, and calibrate blends.\n\nPrioritized action plan\n1) Triage (30 min)\n- Verify submission integrity: shape equals sample, Id = 0..N-1 in test order, Predicted in train category_id space, no NaNs, no 1↔0 indexing shift.\n- Sanity OOF: quick CV (small split) with your prototype/linear-probe; if OOF macro-F1 > 0.1 but LB ~0, your Id/mapping is wrong.\n- Label mapping: ensure idx2cat_id maps exactly to categories.category_id; check Predicted nunique is in the thousands.\n\n2) Quick but limited wins (time-box to a few hours)\n- Finish 2x-TTA embeddings and run linear-probe + prototype blend; calibrate alpha (prior), temperature, and proto_scale on OOF.\n- Upgrade embeddings for the retrieval component if time: OpenCLIP ViT-L/14 or EVA02-L/14; normalize, 2–4x TTA; use FAISS-GPU if doing kNN.\n- Expect this to move you toward 0.1–0.3 macro-F1, not bronze.\n\n3) Main path to bronze (core work)\n- Train a strong classifier (timm): convnextv2_base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k (or convnext_base 384), EVA02/BEiTv2 as alternates if resources allow.\n- Recipe (OOF-driven):\n  - Data/resolution: start 320–384, optionally fine-tune at 384–448; RandAug/AutoAug + ColorJitter + light MixUp/CutMix; RandomErasing.\n  - Loss/imbalance: Balanced Softmax or Logit-Adjusted CE (LADE); optionally LDAM-DRW or Focal as ablations; class-balanced sampler or reweighting.\n  - Optim/training: AdamW + cosine schedule (warmup), EMA, mixed precision, channels_last, torch.compile; large batch or gradient accumulation; num_workers 8+, pin_memory.\n  - Validation: 5-fold StratifiedKFold by category_id; prefer StratifiedGroupKFold grouping by institution_id to handle domain shift; track OOF macro-F1.\n  - TTA at test: multi-scale (e.g., 336/384/448) + hflip (+ 5-crop if stable).\n- Save OOF and test logits for each fold/seed.\n\n4) Blend and calibrate\n- Logit-average across folds/seeds/backbones; blend classifier ensemble with calibrated retrieval head (e.g., 70% classifier, 30% retrieval), weights set by OOF.\n- Apply temperature scaling on OOF before final blending.\n\n5) Exploit taxonomy and distances (often worth several points)\n- Hierarchical targets: label smoothing with genus/family neighbors or with the provided distances matrix.\n- Multi-task heads: add auxiliary genus/family heads alongside species; small loss weights.\n- Post-processing: diffuse logits over nearby taxa via exp(-λ·distance), tuned on OOF.\n\n6) Error analysis and iteration\n- Bucket OOF errors by institution_id, family/genus, image size/orientation; adjust augmentations/sampling where weak.\n- Avoid over-strong MixUp/CutMix (can hurt macro-F1 on long-tail); verify gains with OOF.\n\nResource/use tips\n- On A10 (24GB): push batch size; AMP + channels_last; monitor GPU; increase dataloader workers; consider progressive resizing to fit higher res.\n- Keep retrieval as a single component; do not over-tune it at the expense of classifier training.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Misaligned Ids or wrong label index space in submission.\n- No OOF validation; uncalibrated blends.\n- CPU kNN at scale; not normalizing embeddings.\n- Ignoring long-tail (no balancing) or domain shift (no group-aware CV).\n\nNext 24 hours\n- Fix submission/label mapping and re-submit.\n- Finish TTA + linear-probe+prototype blend; calibrate on OOF; submit for a safer baseline.\n- Start 5-fold convnextv2_base training at 320→384 with Balanced Softmax/LADE, EMA, and strong but moderate aug; save OOF/test logits.\n- Blend classifier logits with retrieval; temperature-scale on OOF; submit. Iterate once based on OOF.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-28 21:32:17] Cell 7 in `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb` has been executing for 740s and is still executing.

    "llm_json": "**Planning model training**\n\nI’m planning to keep things minimal for starting training with 6-8 epochs. In the next step, I’ll execute the training function and start with one fold, knowing it may take a while—about 1-1.5 hours per epoch. I'll set up code to save checkpoints and logs after each epoch. The code will import necessary libraries, build folds, define the dataset class with augmentations, and create the model using pre-trained weights, enabling features for better performance.**Implementing loss adjustments**\n\nThe suggestion to add log(prior) to the logits during loss calculation is interesting. I’ll implement it like this: calculate the logits from the model, adjust the logits by adding the log_prior, and compute the loss using Cross-Entropy. It seems that at inference, I should just use logits without the prior for Logit-Adjusted Cross-Entropy (LADE). \n\nI’ll set up AdamW optimization with a cosine learning rate schedule, use DataLoader parameters with workers for efficiency, and train for about 6 epochs while monitoring performance using macro-F1 scores.**Setting up training details**\n\nI’ll compute validation predictions using `torch.no_grad()` and handle predictions in chunks. Though calculating macro-F1 with `sklearn` may be heavy, it should be manageable. I'll log these metrics per epoch and save the best model checkpoint in the `checkpoints` directory.\n\nFor data transformations, using `torchvision.transforms` seems simpler. I'll include steps like `RandomResizedCrop`, `RandomHorizontalFlip`, and `ColorJitter`, plus apply normalization. \n\nI'll also use mixed precision for efficiency, with a batch size of 48. Starting with a smoke test of 1 epoch before ramping up to 6-8 seems wise.**Preparing for training execution**\n\nI recognize that the training will take time, but I want to ensure everything works correctly. I’ll include an `epochs=1` parameter for now, allowing for adjustments later. Since Cell 8 is still running, I can add a new code cell at index 9 for the training pipeline to start with 1 epoch using a smaller batch size for quicker verification.\n\nI’ll reuse `train_df` created earlier and implement folds using `StratifiedKFold`, along with computing class priors. Finally, I’ll ensure to handle logits on validation and incorporate EMA with `ModelEmaV2`.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 9,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# ConvNeXtV2 Base @384 training (single strong fold) with Logit-Adjusted CE, EMA, AMP\",\n      \"import os, time, math, json, random, gc\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\",\n      \"import torch\",\n      \"import torch.nn as nn\",\n      \"import torch.nn.functional as F\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"import torchvision.transforms as T\",\n      \"from PIL import Image, ImageFile\",\n      \"import timm\",\n      \"from timm.utils import ModelEmaV2\",\n      \"\",\n      \"ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True\",\n      \"torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def seed_all(s=42):\",\n      \"    random.seed(s);

    "llm_json": "**Considering tool usage and checkpoints**\n\nI’m figuring out that we need to choose one tool for our current tasks. Cell 9 is focused on training and executing, and it seems like a good point to request expert review during this major milestone. Since we're starting classifier training, I want to ask about settings, early stopping, and possibly adding a genus head or using soft labels. Additionally, while training is happening, I can prepare cells for inference but can't edit and execute at the same time. After training, I’ll have to add an inference cell to run best checkpoints and generate outputs for submission.**Planning classifier submission process**\n\nI’m thinking about creating a submission for the classifier and blending it with retrieval. First, I'll add cell 10, which will do a few key things. It will load the best checkpoint, run inference on the test data with TTA, compute logits, and write out a submission file. I can also choose to save the test logits for blending later. I’ll need to ensure I have the right mappings and set up the dataset and transformations correctly. Once training finishes, I’ll execute this new cell.**Implementing training strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to let the training run while I take a short break or just add a new cell. I’m thinking about loading the ModelEmaV2, but since we've saved the state_dict, I can directly load the weights into the model without the EMA wrapper. For TTA, I’ll create a transform for horizontal flipping and return both original and flipped tensors during dataset preparation. I’ll also make sure to use `torch.no_grad` and AMP for efficiency. Next, I’ll insert the new cell into the workflow.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 10,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Inference: load EMA-best convnextv2_base and run 2x TTA on test, save logits and submission\",\n      \"import time, numpy as np, torch, torchvision.transforms as T\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"from PIL import Image, ImageFile\",\n      \"import timm\",\n      \"ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True\",\n      \"\",\n      \"device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\",\n      \"best_ckpt = sorted(list(ckpt_dir.glob('cnv2b384_fold0_ema_best.pth')), key=lambda p: p.stat().st_mtime)[-1] if list(ckpt_dir.glob('cnv2b384_fold0_ema_best.pth')) else None\",\n      \"print('Best checkpoint:', best_ckpt)\",\n      \"assert best_ckpt is not None, 'No best checkpoint found.'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Recreate model and load weights\",\n      \"model_inf = timm.create_model(model_name, pretrained=False, num_classes=num_classes).to(device).to(memory_format=torch.channels_last)\",\n      \"ckpt = torch.load(best_ckpt, map_location=device)\",\n      \"model_inf.load_state_dict(ckpt['model'], strict=True)\",\n      \"model_inf.eval()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Test transforms\",\n      \"img_size = 384\",\n      \"mean = (0.485, 0.456, 0.406); std = (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)\",\n      \"test_tfms = T.Compose([\",\n      \"    T.Resize(int(img_size*1.05)),\",\n      \"    T.CenterCrop(img_size),\",\n      \"    T.ToTensor(),\",\n      \"    T.Normalize(mean, std),\",\n      \"])\",\n      \"\",\n      \"class TestDS(Dataset):\",\n      \"    def __init__(self, df, tfm):\",\n      \"        self.df = df.reset_index(drop=True)\",\n      \"        self.tfm = tfm\",\n      \"    def __len__(self): return len(self.df)\",\n      \"    def __getitem__(self, i):\",\n      \"        p = self.df.at[i, 'path']\",\n      \"        try:\",\n      \"            img = Image.open(p).convert('RGB')\",\n      \"        except Exception:\",\n      \"            img = Image.new('RGB', (img_size, img_size), (0,0,0))\",\n      \"        x = self.tfm(img)\",\n      \"        return x, i\",\n      \"\",\n      \"test_ds = TestDS(test_df, test_tfms)\",\n      \"bs_inf = 128\",\n      \"num_workers = 10\",\n      \"test_dl = DataLoader(test_ds, batch_size=bs_inf, shuffle=False, num_workers=num_workers, pin_memory=True, persistent_workers=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Inference with 2x TTA (orig + hflip), average logits; save logits fp16 and submission\",\n      \"Nte = len(test_ds)\",\n      \"logits_fp16 = np.memmap('logits_test_fp16.mmap', dtype='float16', mode='w+', shape=(Nte, num_classes))\",\n      \"t0 = time.time(); seen = 0\",\n      \"with torch.no_grad(), torch.amp.autocast('cuda', enabled=(device=='cuda')):\",\n      \"    for xb, idx in test_dl:\",\n      \"        xb = xb.to(device, non_blocking=True).to(memory_format=torch.channels_last)\",\n      \"        # TTA: original\",\n      \"        lo = model_inf(xb)\",\n      \"        # TTA: hflip\",\n      \"        xf = torch.flip(xb, dims=[-1])\",\n      \"        lf = model_inf(xf)\",\n      \"        l = 0.5 * (lo + lf)\",\n      \"        l = l.float()  # keep in fp32 before saving as fp16\",\n      \"        logits_fp16[idx.numpy()] = l.cpu().numpy().astype('float16')\",\n      \"        seen += xb.size(0)\",\n      \"        if seen % (bs_inf*10) == 0:\",\n      \"            print(f'Infer {seen}/{Nte} (elapsed {time.time()-t0:.1f}s)', flush=True)\",\n      \"del logits_fp16\",\n      \"np.save('logits_test_fp16.npy', np.memmap('logits_test_fp16.mmap', dtype='float16', mode='r', shape=(Nte, num_classes)))\",\n      \"import os\",\n      \"try: os.remove('logits_test_fp16.mmap')\",\n      \"except: pass\",\n      \"print('Saved logits_test_fp16.npy')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Build submission (argmax)\",\n      \"logits = np.load('logits_test_fp16.npy').astype('float32')\",\n      \"preds = logits.argmax(axis=1).astype(np.int32)\",\n      \"pred_cat = [idx2cat_id[int(i)] for i in preds]\",\n      \"sub = pd.DataFrame({'Id': np.arange(len(test_df), dtype=np.int32), 'Predicted': pred_cat})\",\n      \"sub.to_csv('submission_classifier.csv', index=False)\",\n      \"print('Wrote submission_classifier.csv')\",\n      \"print('Inference total elapsed: %.1f s' % (time.time()-t0))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Optionally keep logits for later blending with retrieval head\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\"\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Added Cell 10 to run classifier inference after training finishes: loads EMA-best checkpoint, performs 2x TTA (orig+hflip) at 384 on test, saves fp16 logits to logits_test_fp16.npy and writes submission_classifier.csv via argmax.

Okay, let’s move forward with these considerations and see how they might impact the model performance!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint: we kicked off main classifier training in Cell 9 (convnextv2_base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k @384, AMP, channels_last, EMA=0.99985, AdamW + cosine warmup). Fold0 split: train 532,576 / valid 133,144. Loss = Logit-Adjusted CE (add log-prior to logits). Augs: RRC(0.85-1.0), HFlip, TrivialAug, ColorJitter, RandomErasing. Batch=48, workers=10. We also finished the retrieval v2: 2x TTA OpenCLIP embeddings, linear probe + prototype blend (0.7/0.3, proto_scale=10, alpha=0.5) and wrote submission.csv. Requests: 1) Hyperparam sanity: Is LADE (log-prior on logits) good to keep vs Balanced Softmax? Any tweaks to prior smoothing or alpha to prefer? 2) Batch/throughput on A10 24GB: Is bs=48 fine? If OOM, would you prefer grad accumulation to eff_bs\\u2248256 or reduce img_size to 352 for epoch-1 burn-in? 3) EMA decay 0.99985 OK for 6\\u20138 epochs at this dataset size? 4) Augs: Keep TrivialAugWide + ColorJitter + RandomErasing only (no MixUp/CutMix)? Any herbarium-specific aug to add/remove? 5) Additions worth doing now with low code: - auxiliary genus head (species CE + 0.2*genus CE): simple head split from penultimate features in timm? Minimal code sketch guidance appreciated. - Distance-based soft labels from metadata['distances']: quick recipe to mix 0.8 one-hot + 0.2 soft with T\\u22484 in our current CE framework (per-class target probs) without overhauling the pipeline. 6) Validation: We used 5-fold StratifiedKFold (no grouping). Is grouping by institution_id worth the extra complexity/time here, or proceed as-is? 7) Inference/TTA: Is 2x (orig+hflip) sufficient, or add light scale jitter (\\u00b15%) for 4x? Any temperature scaling target? 8) Post-training blending: Recommend initial weights 0.8 classifier + 0.2 retrieval (our linear+proto). If we add a KNN head on classifier features, is 0.1\\u20130.2 weight typical? 9) Runtime guardrails: Expected epoch time on A10 for this setup? If training is >1.5h/epoch, would you reduce img_size or epochs first? 10) Any pitfalls spotted in our Cell 9 code (e.g., missing zero_grad set_to_none, EMA update placement, validation without prior adjustment) before we let it run for hours? We will keep training running; please advise critical adjustments we should implement early while the first epoch is in progress.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the tight, medal-focused synthesis with concrete calls you can make while epoch 1 runs.\n\nImmediate, high-ROI fixes (do now)\n- Fix dataset indexing (huge speedup):\n  - Replace ImgDS with:\n    class ImgDS(Dataset):\n        def __init__(self, df, indices, tfm):\n            self.df = df.loc[indices].reset_index(drop=True)\n            self.tfm = tfm\n        def __len__(self): return len(self.df)\n        def __getitem__(self, i):\n            row = self.df.iloc[i]\n            path = row['path']; y = int(row['y'])\n            try: img = Image.open(path).convert('RGB')\n            except: img = Image.new('RGB', (img_size, img_size), (0,0,0))\n            return self.tfm(img), y\n- Add gradient clipping for stability (right before scaler.step):\n  torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)\n- Optional but safe: start EMA after warmup:\n  if it >= warmup_steps: ema.update(model)\n\nAnswers to your 10 questions\n\n1) LADE vs Balanced Softmax\n- Keep LADE (logits + log_prior) as implemented. It’s essentially Balanced Softmax and works well here.\n- Prior smoothing: your add-1 is fine. Optional: Dirichlet-style smoothing with smaller epsilon (e.g., +0.1) if you suspect over-correction later.\n- No need for an extra alpha scale on log_prior during training.\n\n2) Batch/throughput on A10 24GB\n- bs=48 @384 should fit. If OOM, use grad accumulation to reach eff_bs≈192–256 rather than reducing image size.\n- If slow, fix the dataset indexing first (above). Only then consider accumulate or adjust workers/prefetch_factor=4.\n\n3) EMA decay\n- 0.99985 is appropriate for 6–8 epochs. Optional: gate EMA until after warmup.\n\n4) Augmentations\n- Keep: RRC(0.85–1.0), HFlip, TrivialAugWide, ColorJitter, small RandomErasing. Avoid MixUp/CutMix. If needed, mild RandomRotation(-10,10, p≈0.3) is herbarium-safe.\n\n5) Low-code additions\n- Auxiliary genus head (recommended, +0.01–0.03 F1):\n  - Build genus_y in your dataset (map category_id→genus_id→0..G-1).\n  - Model:\n    base = timm.create_model(model_name, pretrained=True, num_classes=0)\n    feat_dim = base.num_features\n    class SpeciesGenus(nn.Module):\n        def __init__(self, backbone, feat_dim, C, G):\n            super().__init__()\n            self.backbone = backbone\n            self.head_s = nn.Linear(feat_dim, C)\n            self.head_g = nn.Linear(feat_dim, G)\n        def forward(self, x):\n            f = self.backbone.forward_features(x)\n            f = self.backbone.global_pool(f)\n            return self.head_s(f), self.head_g(f)\n  - Loss:\n    logits_s, logits_g = model(xb)\n    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits_s + log_prior.unsqueeze(0), y_species) + 0.2*F.cross_entropy(logits_g, y_genus)\n- Distance-based soft labels (good ROI; do if time):\n  - Precompute top-K neighbors per class from metadata['distances'] to avoid CxC RAM:\n    K, T = 32, 4.0\n    nbr_idx[c], nbr_w[c] = top-K of exp(-dist/T) normalized (exclude self)\n  - Training loss (with LADE):\n    tgt = torch.zeros(B, C, device=device); tgt[arange(B), yb] = 0.8\n    nn_i = nbr_idx[yb]; nn_w = nbr_w[yb]*(0.2)\n    tgt.scatter_add_(1, nn_i, nn_w)\n    logp = F.log_softmax(logits + log_prior.unsqueeze(0), dim=1)\n    loss = -(tgt*logp).sum(1).mean()\n  - If it over-flattens, reduce soft mix to 0.1.\n\n6) Validation protocol\n- Keep 5-fold StratifiedKFold. Grouping by institution_id is not worth the complexity now.\n\n7) Inference/TTA\n- 2x (orig + hflip) is sufficient. Add ±5% scale jitter for 4x only if time; gain is small.\n- Temperature scaling: skip for first pass; macro-F1 won’t benefit much.\n\n8) Post-training blending\n- Start at 0.8 classifier + 0.2 retrieval (your linear+proto v2). If you add a kNN head on classifier features, blend it at 0.1–0.2.\n\n9) Runtime guardrails\n- Expect ~60–90 min/epoch on A10 with bs=48 @384 if dataloader is fixed. If >1.5 h:\n  - First: ensure ImgDS fix and consider prefetch_factor=4.\n  - Second: keep 6 epochs (don’t drop image size).\n  - Third: use grad accumulation (e.g., bs=32 with accum 6–8).\n\n10) Pitfalls in Cell 9\n- Critical: current ImgDS uses df.loc[...] per sample; fix with the subset/reset_index version above.\n- AMP API: you already use torch.amp in Cell 9 (good). In older cells, update deprecated torch.cuda.amp usages when you revisit them.\n- EMA update placement is good (after optimizer step). zero_grad(set_to_none=True) is good.\n- Validation correctly uses raw logits (no prior adjustment) — keep it.\n\nTTA/blending after classifier\n- 2x TTA logits from classifier, blend with retrieval as planned. If you add a kNN head on the classifier features (FAISS top-32–64 with softmax(sim/0.1) to class scores), blend at ~0.1.\n\nSummary priorities\n1) Fix ImgDS indexing and add grad clipping now. Let training run.\n2) If epoch 1 F1 looks healthy, consider adding the genus head for a short fine-tune; soft labels if time remains.\n3) Keep 2x TTA. Blend 0.8/0.2 with retrieval for submission.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: train a strong supervised classifier now, upgrade the retrieval head, exploit hierarchy/distances, and blend with OOF-calibrated weights. Prioritize steps that move macro-F1 the most; avoid spending time on minor retrieval tweaks.\n\nPriorities (in order)\n- Classifier first: convnextv2_base@384 (then 512 short finetune), EMA, AMP, channels_last. Target >0.5 OOF by 6–8 epochs.\n- Upgrade retrieval: re-extract with OpenCLIP ViT-L/14-336 (or ViT-H/14 if available), 2x TTA, class prototypes + debias.\n- Use hierarchy/distances: genus gating and distance-based smoothing/rerank.\n- Blend and ensemble: start 0.7 classifier / 0.3 retrieval; add a second backbone/seed if time.\n- Validate everything OOF (macro-F1), not on LB.\n\nClassifier recipe (long-tail ready)\n- Model/schedule: convnextv2_base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k, img=384, epochs=6–8, AdamW lr=3e-4 wd=0.05, cosine + 1 epoch warmup, EMA=0.99985, AMP, channels_last.\n- Loss/imbalance: Logit-Adjusted CE (Balanced Softmax) using train priors. Alternatives (pick 1 via OOF): Focal (gamma 1.5–2), EQLv2/Seesaw. Either class-balanced sampler or class-weighted loss, not both.\n- Augmentations: RandomResizedCrop(0.85–1.0), HFlip 0.5, TrivialAugment, light ColorJitter, RandomErasing small. Keep Mixup ≤0.1, CutMix ≤0.3. Avoid strong VFlip/rotations.\n- Validation: 5-fold stratified by category_id; also check frequency-bin coverage. Track macro-F1 OOF; save EMA-best.\n\nRetrieval upgrades (fast wins)\n- Backbone: OpenCLIP ViT-L/14-336 (or convnext_xxlarge CLIP). 2x TTA (orig+hflip), L2-normalize features.\n- Prototypes: mean per class; cosine logits with scale 10–20; debias with alpha=0.5–0.7 (tune on OOF). Consider FAISS GPU only for reranking if needed.\n- Genus gating: predict genus (prototypes on genus) and score species only within top-k genera (k≈3–5).\n\nHierarchy and distances (high leverage)\n- Distance smoothing: build S = exp(-dist/τ), τ≈0.1–0.3; post-multiply logits by S (or re-rank top-k) to fix near-miss species. Use sparse top-k per class for memory.\n- Optional multi-task: add an auxiliary genus head or soft labels within genus.\n\nBlending, calibration, ensembling\n- Start blend: 0.7 classifier + 0.3 retrieval in logit space; tune on OOF. Temperature-scale classifier logits on OOF.\n- TTA inference: center + hflip; if time, multi-scale (384/448/512). Use EMA weights.\n- Add diversity if time: second backbone (beitv2_large, eva02_base/large, efficientnetv2_l) or second seed/resolution; logit-average with weights from OOF.\n\nPitfalls to avoid\n- Over-optimizing retrieval; it will plateau <0.5 alone.\n- Ignoring rare classes (macro-F1); using micro metrics; too-strong augs; too many epochs (overfit).\n- CPU kNN at full scale; label/index mapping mismatches; not using the provided distances/hierarchy.\n\n48–72h action plan\n- Now: Launch convnextv2_base@384 training (6–8 epochs) with LADE + EMA; monitor OOF macro-F1 per epoch.\n- Parallel: Re-extract CLIP embeddings with ViT-L/14-336 (2x TTA); rebuild prototypes; tune alpha, scale; add genus gating.\n- Tomorrow: Classifier inference (2x TTA), temperature-scale on OOF, blend 0.7/0.3, submit. If OOF <0.6, add short 512 finetune and/or a second backbone/seed.\n- Final: Apply distance-based smoothing/rerank to blended logits; re-submit.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-28 21:42:15] Cell 9 in `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb` has been executing for 6s and is still executing.

    "llm_json": "**Optimizing model settings**\n\nI want to set up gradient checkpointing if it's available and ensure we're cleaning up the kernel. If there's an OOM issue, I should think about reducing the image size to 352 instead of 384, though lowering the batch size should be my first move. Bfloat16 is another option to explore since A10 supports it—though float16 is picked by default. Next, I need to edit the batch size and incorporate accumulation logic to optimize the training loop efficiently.**Modifying training parameters**\n\nI can only focus on one tool at a time, so I'll start by editing cell 9. I'll set the batch size to 16 and add in an accumulation step of 8. Adjusting the DataLoader to drop the last batch makes sense too. \n\nIn the loop, I’ll scale the loss accordingly and manage when to run unscale and optimizer operations based on the accumulation steps. Also, I need to revise the EMA update to align with the optimizer steps and recalculate the warmup steps based on the adjusted training data length.**Implementing model modifications**\n\nAlright, I want to ensure I'm adding `model.set_grad_checkpointing(True)` if it's possible. I'll also consider memory-efficient attention, but it seems that this option might not apply here. So, let’s go ahead and implement these modifications to optimize the model. It's important to ensure everything is set up correctly to get the best performance! I'm eager to see how these changes contribute to improved efficiency.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 9,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# ConvNeXtV2 Base @384 training (single strong fold) with Logit-Adjusted CE, EMA, AMP\",\n      \"import os, time, math, json, random, gc\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\",\n      \"import torch\",\n      \"import torch.nn as nn\",\n      \"import torch.nn.functional as F\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"import torchvision.transforms as T\",\n      \"from PIL import Image, ImageFile\",\n      \"import timm\",\n      \"from timm.utils import ModelEmaV2\",\n      \"\",\n      \"ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True\",\n      \"torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def seed_all(s=42):\",\n      \"    random.seed(s);

It currently uses a filename pattern that won’t match the glob I need. I should change it to look for `cnv2x384_*` instead. I can safely modify Cell 10 while training is ongoing. I'm also considering whether the `model_name` exists in a fresh kernel, but it should still be there since we're running inference after training in the same kernel. It’s a good time to make these adjustments!**Implementing checkpoint modifications**\n\nI need to use the edit_file tool to modify Cell 10. This involves loading the checkpoint path by searching for files matching the pattern `cnv2x384_*_fold0_ema_best.pth`. I should also load the configuration from the checkpoint to create the model. As for `num_classes`, I need to decide whether to get that from `train_df` or the checkpoint. I think it's safe to assume `train_df` is available in the kernel.

I wonder if I can request an expert review meanwhile. Adding a small logging cell might be helpful, though I can't edit and execute at the same time. Preparing a genus head extension in a new cell could be wise, but I should keep it simple. I must ensure that submission exists after the linear probe but may skip submitting until I'm confident.**Planning for blending logits**\n\nWhen it comes to blending, it seems better to run classifier inference later and then combine predictions by weighting logits. However, we don't currently have retrieval logits available. I could create retrieval logits from prototype logits for the test set using embeddings, but we didn’t save those earlier. I can set up a new cell to compute retrieval logits from TTA features and save them to a file. It's efficient to compute and save these now, even if the GPU is occupied by training. Let's go ahead and prepare that code cell!**Setting up proto logits and blending**\n\nI can load TTA embeddings to compute the prototype logits and save them as `proto_logits.npy`. Later, I plan to add a blending cell to read the classifier logits and compose the final submission using `logits_test_fp16.npy` and the proto logits. \n\nI’ll create two new cells: Cell 11 for computing proto logits from the test embeddings and class prototypes, and Cell 12 for blending those logits. I’ll be careful not to overload memory while inserting these cells. Perhaps it’s best to keep them separate, but I can consider combining functions in a multi-purpose cell if needed!**Implementing embedding processing and blending**\n\nI’m ready to implement the following steps: First, I’ll load the TTA embeddings paths just like before. Then, I’ll compute the prototypes and proto logits for the test set using chunking with a batch size of 2048, a scale of 12, and an alpha of 0.5. I’ll save these as `proto_logits_fp16.npy`. \n\nIf `logits_test_fp16.npy` exists, I’ll load both sets, compute the blended logits with the right shapes, and write them to `submission_blend.csv`. If not, I might just produce `submission_proto.csv` as a backup.

It looks like I could wait for at least epoch 1 to complete before proceeding. Currently, I'm at step 800 out of 24,966, so there’s a long way to go. With roughly 200 steps taking 15 minutes, it seems like reaching completion will take about 31.2 hours per epoch, which is way too slow. I might need to adjust settings to speed things up.**Considering adjustments for training**\n\nI’m contemplating reducing the dataset size to speed up training. One idea is to use fewer steps per epoch by training on a subset of images or resizing them to 320 or 256 pixels. Disabling gradient checkpointing could help a bit, but loading images seems to be the main bottleneck. I’m also thinking about increasing num_workers to 16-20, but I might not have the necessary tools to optimize image loading. Given the slow epoch time, I need to interrupt training to modify parameters significantly.**Modifying training parameters**\n\nI need to interrupt cell 9 to make necessary modifications. I plan to set the image size to 320 and increase the number of workers to 16, while checking if I can use torchvision's efficient backend. There’s also a possibility of optimizing the augmentations by dropping costly TrivialAug and reducing ColorJitter’s CPU usage. I’ll increase the batch size to 32 and reduce accum_steps to 4, which should help keep updates per epoch while speeding up the process. It’s all about finding that balance!**Planning adjustments for efficiency**\n\nMy main goal is to reduce wall time. Lowering the image size will cut down on computation, while increasing the batch size will minimize data loader overhead. I’m considering using a compiled model like torch.compile, but that might add some overhead initially, so I’ll skip that for now. Caching isn't feasible, and I might limit the number of training samples per epoch to optimize performance. To proceed, I’ll interrupt and modify cell 9 with new parameters, including setting img_size to 320, batch_size to 32, and simplifying augmentations.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"execute_code\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"code_execution_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"interrupt\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 9\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Throughput is far too slow (~200 optimizer steps per 15 min \\u2192 >30h per epoch).

    "llm_json": "**Modifying training parameters**\n\nI need to choose one tool action since the current training is interrupted due to throughput issues. To speed things up, I want to modify Cell 9 with a few adjustments. First, I'll reduce the image size to 320 and simplify augmentations. I’m considering using Resize plus RandomCrop and replacing TrivialAugWide with RandAugment. I’ll also increase the number of workers and adjust the batch size and accumulation steps. Finally, I might disable gradient checkpointing for efficiency.**Adjusting training configuration**\n\nI’m thinking about setting an attribute in timm regarding the `set_grad_checkpointing` argument and whether it supports `use_reentrant`. However, it might be simpler to just avoid using gradient checkpointing altogether. Also, calculating the `updates_per_epoch` earlier is a good idea. I could implement a \"train samples per epoch\" system using a subset sampler, but it might be best to keep the full dataset. I’ll also log every 100 steps and consider adding a `prefetch_factor` of 6—time to modify Cell 9!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 9,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# ConvNeXtV2 training (speed-tuned) with LADE, EMA, AMP\",\n      \"import os, time, math, json, random, gc\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\",\n      \"import torch\",\n      \"import torch.nn as nn\",\n      \"import torch.nn.functional as F\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"import torchvision.transforms as T\",\n      \"from PIL import Image, ImageFile\",\n      \"import timm\",\n      \"from timm.utils import ModelEmaV2\",\n      \"\",\n      \"ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True\",\n      \"torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def seed_all(s=42):\",\n      \"    random.seed(s);

    "llm_json": "**Optimizing training steps**\n\nI'm thinking about using a subset of my training for quicker predictions, though winning needs more training time. I still have about 21 hours left, but the current estimate of 5 hours per epoch at 320 seems too lengthy. I’m considering switching to convnextv2_small with an image size of 288, and a batch size of 48 while accumulating 4. I'll also remove ColorJitter to speed things up and increase logging. I should clarify the max updates per epoch and recheck previous configurations.**Clarifying training metrics**\n\nI'm looking at the total steps calculated as epochs times updates per epoch. I got 24,966 for updates per epoch, which means about 4,161 for 6 epochs after dividing. The message showing \"ep 1 step 200/24966\" implies that total steps across all epochs were printed incorrectly. To achieve an hour per epoch, I'll need about 4 times the speed. I'll reduce the image size to 256, remove color jitter, increase batch size to 48, and change accumulation to 2 for efficiency. I should also prioritize smaller models for faster processing!**Adjusting model parameters**\n\nI’m concerned that A10 might run out of memory with a classifier head handling 15,501 classes. However, I think using convnextv2_small with an image size of 256 could allow a batch size of 64. To be conservative, I’ll stick to a batch size of 48 and accumulate to 2 for an effective batch size of 96. By removing ColorJitter and RandomErasing, I can speed things up while keeping RRC and HFlip. I’ll also consider limiting the training size initially, but I want to be careful about unique class representation for macro-F1 scores.

Context: A10 24GB, torch 2.4.1 cu121. We pivoted to a speed-tuned ConvNeXtV2 classifier to get a medal-viable baseline fast. Current Cell 9 config: convnextv2_small (fallback tiny -> base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k), img_size=256, batch_size=64, accum_steps=1, num_workers=16, simple aug (RRC+HFlip), LADE (log-prior adjustment), EMA (ModelEmaV2, decay=0.99985), AMP (torch.amp autocast+GradScaler), cosine LR with 1 warmup epoch, 6 total epochs, 5-fold split but training only fold 0. channels_last + TF32 enabled. Goals: 1-1.5 hours/epoch throughput, train an EMA-best checkpoint, run 2x TTA inference (Cell 10), then blend with retrieval logits (Cell 11). Ask: 1) Is convnextv2_small@256 the right speed/accuracy tradeoff on A10-24GB, or should we push batch_size (96-128) for better throughput, or use convnextv2_tiny with higher img_size? 2) Are we missing key recipe elements for long-tail herbs: mixup/cutmix/light label smoothing vs LADE, or class-balanced sampling? If adding mixup/cutmix, what magnitudes keep throughput high? 3) Suggested LR/epochs for quick win: is lr=3e-4 with 6 epochs sufficient, or should we do 8-10 epochs with strong EMA? 4) Any timm flags to speed up: timm.data.create_transform, interpolation='bicubic', re_prob, random erasing? 5) Expected it/s or hours/epoch on A10 for convnextv2_small@256 bs=64 so we can sanity-check throughput. 6) Any red flags in Cell 9 logic? We fixed the timm pretrained tag issue and UnboundLocalError, but want confirmation the EMA usage and LADE application (adding log_prior to logits) is sound. 7) For inference (Cell 10), we'll fix the glob pattern to img_size=256; any advice on TTA schemes for convnextv2 that pay off (e.g., flip-only vs 5-crop) given time constraints? 8) Finally, do you recommend blending this classifier (0.8) with our OpenCLIP TTA prototype logits (0.2) as configured in Cell 11 for macro-F1 gains on this competition? If not, suggest better blend weights. We plan to start training immediately after your feedback unless there is a faster path to a medal.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a consolidated, do-now plan to get a medal quickly, pulling the best from all four audits and matching your current Cell 9/10/11 state.\n\nPriority changes before training\n- Batch size: Try bs=96 first. If OOM, drop to 80/72/64. Keep accum_steps=1.\n- EMA on CPU to free VRAM: ema = ModelEmaV2(model, decay=0.99985, device='cpu').\n- Transforms: switch to timm’s create_transform with bicubic + light random erasing. Keep aug light.\n- Keep LADE; no class-balanced sampler. Consider light label smoothing (0.05) or light mixup only if needed.\n- Keep grad clipping (you already have it) and gate EMA after warmup (you already do).\n\nMinimal code edits\n- Transforms (replace your train/valid_tfms in Cell 9):\n  from timm.data import create_transform\n  train_tfms = create_transform(\n      input_size=img_size, is_training=True,\n      scale=(0.9, 1.0), ratio=(0.8, 1.25), hflip=0.5,\n      interpolation='bicubic', mean=mean, std=std,\n      re_prob=0.25, re_mode='pixel'\n  )\n  valid_tfms = create_transform(\n      input_size=img_size, is_training=False,\n      interpolation='bicubic', mean=mean, std=std\n  )\n\n- EMA on CPU (Cell 9):\n  ema = ModelEmaV2(model, decay=ema_decay, device='cpu')\n\n- Optional loss tweak (works with LADE; small, safe boost). Replace the CE line with label smoothing:\n  loss = F.cross_entropy(logits_adj, yb, label_smoothing=0.05) / max(1, accum_steps)\n  Keep this off if you plan to add mixup. If val F1 <0.70 after epoch 1, instead add light mixup:\n    from timm.data.mixup import Mixup\n    mixup_fn = Mixup(mixup_alpha=0.2, cutmix_alpha=0.0, label_smoothing=0.0, num_classes=num_classes)\n  and apply mixup to inputs/targets and use mixup_fn.get_loss.\n\nDirect answers to your 8 questions\n1) Model/resolution tradeoff:\n- Your convnextv2_small@256 is the right speed/accuracy trade for a fast medal shot on A10. Push bs toward 96 if it fits; otherwise use 64–80. Don’t pivot to tiny@higher res now. Only consider base@320/384 if you have ≥8–10 h train budget.\n\n2) Long-tail recipe:\n- Keep LADE (logits + log_prior) and do not add class-balanced sampling.\n- Start without mixup/cutmix. If early val F1 stalls, add light mixup only: mixup_alpha=0.2, cutmix=0.0.\n- Alternatively, keep mixup off and use label_smoothing=0.05 in CE (compatible with LADE, zero overhead).\n\n3) LR/epochs:\n- lr=3e-4 + cosine + 1 warmup is good.\n- 6 epochs is fine; if epoch time ≤1.3 h, run 8 for safer EMA gains.\n\n4) timm speed/aug flags:\n- Use create_transform + interpolation='bicubic' + re_prob=0.25.\n- Skip heavy RandAug; optional small bump: TrivialAugmentWide later if you have time.\n\n5) Throughput on A10 for small@256, bs=64:\n- Expect ~1.0–1.3 h/epoch (≈1.2–1.8 it/s). If slower, you’re I/O bound; try bs up to 96, workers 12–16, prefetch 4–6.\n\n6) Red flags in Cell 9:\n- Your current logic (LADE, EMA update after warmup, grad clip) is sound.\n- Move EMA to CPU to save VRAM.\n- Keep channels_last + TF32 (already set).\n\n7) Inference/TTA (Cell 10):\n- Use 2x TTA (orig + hflip) only.\n- Fix checkpoint glob to use img_size:\n  ckpts = sorted(glob.glob(str(ckpt_dir / f'cnv2x{img_size}_*_fold0_ema_best.pth')))\n- Everything else in Cell 10 is fine.\n\n8) Blending with OpenCLIP logits (Cell 11):\n- Yes. Keep 0.8 classifier / 0.2 retrieval. If classifier clearly dominates OOF, try 0.85/0.15.\n- Set proto_scale=12 (you already do in Cell 11).\n\nSanity checklist\n- Your ImgDS is efficient; keep it.\n- Dataloaders: num_workers 12–16, pin_memory=True, persistent_workers=True, prefetch_factor 4–6 (you’re good).\n- Save EMA-best by macro-F1 (already implemented).\n- Inference: ensure logits and mapping use same num_classes and idx2cat.\n\nGo/no-go plan\n- Start training now with: bs=96 (fallback to 80/72/64), EMA on CPU, timm transforms with bicubic+RE, CE+LADE (+ optional LS 0.05).\n- If epoch 1 val macro-F1 <0.70, add light mixup alpha=0.2 from epoch 2 onward.\n- Train 6–8 epochs, run 2x TTA inference, then blend 0.8/0.2 with proto logits and submit.\n\nThis path should land you in strong bronze, likely silver after the blend, within your time budget.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: prioritize a robust supervised model, enhance your retrieval with metadata-aware inference, and blend them; fix pipeline blockers first.\n\n1) Unblock and verify\n- Fix training cell:\n  - Use valid timm weights: convnextv2_small (pretrained=True) or convnextv2_base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k. Avoid invalid tags on small.\n  - Initialize mdl = None before try; in except, only del mdl if mdl is not None.\n- Fix inference glob: don’t hardcode cnv2x384_*; match cnv2x*_*_fold0_ema_best.pth.\n- Re-submit your current best retrieval/proto output to confirm submission format; ensure Id is 0..N-1 and Predicted uses train category_id mapping.\n\n2) Training-free, high-impact boosts (fast path to big gains)\n- Institution-aware priors: compute P(class|institution) from train (parse institution from file_name). At inference subtract αinst·log P(class|inst) from logits; tune αinst ∈ [0.3, 1.0] on OOF. Fallback to global prior for unseen institutions.\n- Genus gating: build genus prototypes from train embeddings; score genera per test image, keep top-K genera (K≈3), restrict class candidates to those genera. Fuse scores: class_score = proto_score + λ·genus_score − α·log P(class); tune λ∈[0.2,0.6], α∈[0.3,1.0].\n- Rotation TTA on embeddings: add 90/180/270 + hflip; average features before L2-normalization.\n- Retrieval details: scale prototype logits with temperature τ≈8–16; optional FAISS-GPU re-ranking inside top-K genera; blend neighbor votes at 0.2–0.4.\n\n3) Train one strong supervised classifier (core to reach ≥0.60)\n- Backbone and size (pick one based on VRAM/time):\n  - Fast/solid: convnextv2_base.fcmae_ft_in22k_in1k @ 384 (fallback convnextv2_small @ 320–384).\n  - If ample compute: beitv2_large_patch16_224_in22k (progressive 224→384/448) or eva02_large_patch14_448.\n- Data/augs: RandAug/AutoAug, Mixup 0.2–0.4, CutMix 0.5–1.0, ColorJitter, RandomErasing 0.25; flips + random rotations help plants.\n- Long-tail recipe: LADE (logit-adjusted CE) with τ≈1–1.5; class-balanced or repeat-factor sampler; EMA on weights.\n- Optim/schedule: AdamW (lr≈3e-4, wd 0.05), cosine decay with warmup; AMP (bf16/fp16), channels_last. 8–12 epochs (progressive 224→384) is usually enough; go 20–30 if throughput allows.\n- Throughput/memory: batch size as large as fits; optional grad accumulation (2–4). Prefer higher batch over checkpointing; enable torch.compile if stable.\n- Validation: 5-fold StratifiedKFold by category_id; select by macro-F1 OOF; monitor per-institution/per-genus errors.\n\n4) Inference, blending, and debiasing\n- TTA: flips + 90/180/270 rotations (4–8 views). Average logits.\n- Blend logits: 0.7–0.9 classifier + 0.1–0.3 hierarchical-prototype/retrieval. Temperature-scale each model on OOF before blending.\n- Apply institution-aware debiasing after blending (subtract αinst·log P(class|inst)), then argmax.\n- Sanity: consistent category_id↔index maps; submission shape/order matches sample.\n\n5) Scale if needed (post-bronze push)\n- Add a second diverse backbone (e.g., ViT-B/16 or EfficientNetV2-M) and ensemble 2–3 models; weight by OOF.\n- Pseudo-label high-confidence test samples from the blended model and fine-tune 2–4 more epochs.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Small inputs (256) and weak augs hurt fine-grained detail; target 384+.\n- Retrieval alone caps below medal; use it as hierarchical gating/booster, not the sole predictor.\n- Submission bugs (reordered Ids, invalid category_ids) and mismatched checkpoint globs.\n- Ignoring long-tail: always use rarity-aware loss/sampling and macro-F1 for selection.\n\n48-hour actionable plan\n- Today: implement institution priors + genus gating + rotation TTA on current embeddings; tune αinst, λ, τ on a stratified OOF split; submit.\n- In parallel: fix training cell; train convnextv2_base @ 384 with LADE + balanced sampler, 8–12 epochs, EMA; save EMA-best; run TTA inference.\n- Tomorrow: blend classifier + hierarchical retrieval; apply institution debias; submit. Target OOF ≥0.60; if <0.55, increase image size/epochs or switch to beitv2_large progressive 224→384."

Since I can't edit the running code, it’d be best to take a quick 10-minute nap to catch the results.**Considering expert review**\n\nI’m thinking about requesting an expert review because the F1 score is at 0, which is concerning. We didn’t apply LADE adjustments during validation, leading to raw logits. Generally, evaluation shouldn’t involve adjustments since the test distribution is unknown, but if the training used adjusted logits, I guess predictions could still be based on the unadjusted logits. The F1 score of 0 might indicate a bug, possibly with label mapping. Our validation process seems okay, but the EMA is only updating after warmup, which could affect performance.**Evaluating epoch performance**\n\nIn epoch 1, it looks like the EMA weights are not trained enough since they're close to the initial values, but I still expect a non-zero F1 score. With 15,501 classes, a random macro-F1 could be around 0, especially given the vast valid set, meaning very low metrics might show as 0.00000 when rounded.
