Questions: 1) For the TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge, what medal-winning strategies were most effective?

Should we lock StratifiedGroupKFold by speaker id to mirror LB? Any traps with unknown/silence handling and label mapping we must mirror to avoid leakage/mismatch? 3) Baseline goal: what accuracy is achievable quickly with a 5-fold GroupKFold CNN-mels + SpecAugment? What target should we use for a first pass to be in medal range? 4) Efficiency: given the environment (A10 GPU, PyTorch allowed), would you recommend precomputing mel features to .npy or on-the-fly with caching? Any must-do I/O optimizations? 5) Common mistakes to avoid in this competition (e.g., mislabeling unknown/silence, using non-speaker-aware CV, frequency axes scaling leaks, over-augmenting). Please suggest a concise baseline recipe (mel params, model architecture sketch, training epochs/LR, augments) that can reach strong CV quickly, plus the minimal ensemble to push into medal territory.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: High-impact pivots and a concrete medal path, distilled from multiple top-solution reviews:\n\nImmediate fixes to your plan\n- Replace StratifiedKFold with StratifiedGroupKFold using speaker_id (filename prefix before “_nohash_”). This is the #1 LB-alignment issue.\n- Lock the label set to exactly match sample_submission: typically 10 keywords + unknown + silence.\n- Map all non-target folders to unknown. Generate silence from _background_noise_ 1.0s crops. Keep proportions consistent per fold.\n- Fit all normalization on train-fold only. No global stats.\n\nFeatures that worked best\n- Use log-mel spectrograms (log(mel+1e-6)), SR=16k mono.\n- Strong defaults:\n  - n_fft=512, win_length=400 (25 ms), hop=160 (10 ms), window=hann\n  - n_mels=64–128 (start with 64 or 128), fmin≈20, fmax=8000\n- Normalization:\n  - Either per-utterance mean-std, or train-fold CMVN (per-frequency mean/std computed on train fold; apply to val/test within fold). Avoid fitting on full data.\n\nBackbones and augmentations\n- Backbones (fast/strong): ResNet18 (preferred), EfficientNet-B0 (alternative). Small KWS-specific TC-ResNet8 also works if you prefer tiny models.\n- Key augmentations (keep moderate):\n  - Time shift ±100–200 ms (circular or pad/crop)\n  - SpecAugment: 2× time masks (T≈16–32 frames), 2× freq masks (F≈8–12 mels)\n  - Mixup α=0.2–0.4, p≈0.5 (on spectrograms)\n  - Background noise mixing from _background_noise_ at SNR 5–20 dB, p≈0.5–0.8\n  - Optional light speed perturb 0.9–1.1\n- Apply waveform augments (shift/noise) before mel; apply SpecAugment after mel in training only.\n\nValidation and label traps\n- Use StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42) with groups=speaker_id and y=label.\n- Ensure unknown groups all non-target words; silence are 1s noise crops. Keep both included in stratification.\n- Keep padding/cropping policy identical across train/val/test. Set model.eval() and freeze BN at inference.\n\nTargets (to guide iteration)\n- Quick baseline (simple CNN) with speaker-grouped CV: 0.85–0.88 OOF acc.\n- Medal-viable first pass (ResNet18 + aug): ≥0.89 OOF. Aim 0.90+ after fold ensembling/TTA.\n- Expect LB ≈ OOF − (0.2–1.0) pp depending on split match.\n\nEfficiency on A10\n- Prefer precomputing mel features to .npy/.pt (float16) for train/test to eliminate CPU/I/O variance. Memory-map for fast loads.\n- If on-the-fly: use torchaudio, num_workers 8+, pin_memory=True, persistent_workers=True, prefetch_factor 2–4, simple in-process cache for val.\n- Batch 128–256 for small CNNs/ResNet18; use cosine LR and early stopping.\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid\n- Non speaker-aware CV (big CV→LB gap).\n- Wrong unknown/silence handling or label order mismatch with sample_submission.\n- Fitting normalization on full dataset (leakage).\n- Over-aggressive SpecAugment/mixup causing underfit on short commands.\n- Inconsistent padding/cropping between splits.\n- Forgetting to use background_noise for both training augmentation and building silence.\n\nConcise baseline recipe (strong CV quickly)\n- Data\n  - SR=16k; pad/crop to exactly 1.0s.\n  - Classes: [10 target words] + unknown + silence. Silence ≈10–15% of train; unknown = all non-target folders.\n  - speaker_id = fname.split('_nohash_')[0].\n  - 5-fold StratifiedGroupKFold by (y, speaker_id).\n- Features\n  - Mel A: n_mels=64, n_fft=512, win=400, hop=160, fmin=20, fmax=8000.\n  - Log-mel = log(1e-6 + mel). Train-fold CMVN (per-frequency) or per-utterance z-norm.\n  - Precompute to float16 [1 × n_mels × T] per clip.\n- Model\n  - ResNet18 2D adapted to 1 input channel; global avg pool; dropout 0.2; label smoothing 0.05.\n- Training\n  - Optimizer AdamW (lr=3e-3, wd=1e-4), cosine decay 30 epochs, warmup 1–2 epochs.\n  - Batch 128. Early stop patience 5–7 on val acc.\n  - Augs: time shift ±120 ms (p=0.8), bg-noise mix SNR 5–20 dB (p=0.7), SpecAugment (2× F=10, 2× T=24, p=1.0), mixup α=0.3 (p=0.5).\n- Inference\n  - Disable augments; CMVN only. TTA: average 3 time shifts (e.g., −80, 0, +80 ms).\n  - Average logits across 5 folds. Map indices to labels exactly as sample_submission.\n\nMinimal ensemble to push into medal territory\n- Train same pipeline with a second mel config (Mel B: n_mels=80 or fmax=7600) and/or a second seed. Average logits across folds and configs.\n- If time permits, add a lightweight EfficientNet-B0 variant for diversity.\n\nEdits to your notebook\n- Change “Validation: Stratified KFold” to “StratifiedGroupKFold by speaker_id.”\n- Explicitly implement label mapping for unknown/silence before any CV split.\n- Prefer precomputing mels (float16 .npy/.pt); keep on-the-fly as fallback.\n- Start with ResNet18 over “simple CNN” for main runs.\n\nIf you share the detected label list and sample_submission classes, I can provide an exact mapping dict and class weights.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: execute now with a leakage-free pipeline, correct 12-class mapping (including unknown and silence), grouped CV by speaker, strong augmentations, and a compact CNN; then ensemble folds/models to push past 0.8879.\n\nPriorities (in order)\n1) Data/labels done right\n- Targets: {yes,no,up,down,left,right,on,off,stop,go}. Everything else (except background noise) → unknown.\n- Silence: generate 1s random crops from _background_noise_; aim for ~5–15% of train.\n- Standardize audio: mono, 16 kHz, exactly 1.0s (pad/trim), loudness-normalize per clip.\n- Metadata: extract speaker_id from filename prefix before “_nohash_”.\n\n2) Splits and leakage control\n- Use 5-fold GroupKFold by speaker_id; stratify label distribution.\n- Fit all normalizers/feature scalers inside each fold only.\n- Cache features per fold; no cross-fold augmentation bleed.\n\n3) Features (fast, strong)\n- Log-mel spectrograms: n_fft 512–640, win ~25 ms, hop ~10 ms, n_mels 64 (start), add 1e-6 before log; optional per-feature standardization (per fold).\n- Optional second view: MFCC (13–20 + delta, delta-delta).\n- Cache to disk (.npy/HDF5) to avoid I/O bottlenecks.\n\n4) Augmentations that move the needle\n- Time shift ±100 ms (circular or pad/trim).\n- Additive noise: mix random background crops, SNR ~5–20 dB.\n- Speed perturb 0.9–1.1x (re-pad/trim to 1s).\n- SpecAugment (light-moderate time/freq masks) for spectrogram models.\n- Optional: mixup on spectrograms (alpha 0.2–0.4).\n\n5) Baseline models and path to ensemble\n- Fast baseline A (spectrogram): small 2D CNN or MobileNetV2/EfficientNet-B0 with GA pooling, dropout.\n- Alternative baseline B (raw audio): 1D CNN (Conv1D stacks, optional dilation, global pooling). This trains fast and is competitive.\n- Medal push: ensemble by averaging logits from 5 folds; add diversity via a second feature config (e.g., MFCC or different n_mels) or a 1D CNN branch.\n\n6) Training recipe\n- Loss: cross-entropy with label smoothing 0.05–0.1.\n- Optimizer/schedule: AdamW, cosine decay with warmup; early stopping (patience 5–8).\n- Epochs: 20–40; mixed precision; largest batch that fits GPU.\n- Sampling: keep realistic proportions for unknown/silence; modest class weights if skewed.\n- Save OOF and per-fold test logits.\n\n7) QA and iteration loop\n- Check OOF confusion matrix; unknown vs silence vs targets are common failure modes—adjust noise/shift/mixup if weak.\n- If CV < 0.88: increase augmentation, tune mel params (64→128, hop), try MobileNetV2 if on simple CNN or add 1D CNN branch.\n- Target CV ≥ 0.89 before relying on LB.\n\n8) Inference\n- Fold-averaged logits; optional TTA (small shifts + light noise) for +0.2–0.5%.\n- Submission uses exact 12 label strings and original test filenames.\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid\n- Random KFold (speaker leakage) → always GroupKFold.\n- Wrong label mapping for unknown/silence.\n- Feature leakage (global normalization) and NaNs from log(0) → add epsilon.\n- Overly heavy models on small data; slow I/O (don’t cache).\n- Submission format errors.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Today: implement file inventory, correct label mapping, silence generation, GroupKFold by speaker_id.\n- Build log-mel extractor (64 mels), cache; add core augmentations (shift, noise, speed, SpecAugment).\n- Train 5-fold MobileNetV2 (or small 2D CNN) with AdamW + cosine, label smoothing; save OOF/test logits. Submit fold-averaged predictions.\n- If CV < 0.88: tune mel params and augmentation; consider adding a 1D CNN on raw audio or MFCC model. Ensemble folds/models; add light TTA.\n- Aim: CV ≥ 0.89; then iterate minor boosts (seeds, n_mels diversity) to secure bronze/silver."

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating audio dataset structure**\n\nI’m exploring the Speech Commands v1 structure under train/audio, where I noticed it has multiple classes including target and background noise. The earlier counting issue arose because I only checked the top-level directories, missing the audio subfolders. I need to fix the scanning process to include these. Also, it’s surprising the GPU isn't being utilized—this could slow down training if we rely on the CPU, but we might adapt by using classical features.**Considering feature computation and models**\n\nI'm thinking we could precompute features and apply scikit-learn models like LightGBM on aggregated features. Historically, strong leaderboard results used CNNs, but for this time, maybe combining MFCC with XGBoost could yield decent accuracy. The medal threshold is quite high, around 0.888+, so perhaps gradient boosting on log-mel features could help. First, I need to ensure I have the correct inventory of training files, then build a mapping for the labels and include necessary identifiers from filenames.**Updating training data and environment**\n\nThe training data doesn’t officially label 'silence', but I could generate examples from background noise. I want to create a new notebook cell to build a training dataframe that lists files, labels, and counts while including the mapping for unknowns. I’ll check the background noise files too. It looks like the GPU has to be enabled, but torch cuda isn’t available—which is a bit disappointing. I'll focus on CPU training and precompute mel features, though it might still be slow. Using sklearn for features could be a good alternative.**Building features and selecting models**\n\nFirst, I'll compute log-mel features for both the training and test sets using librosa on the CPU. After that, I plan to train a LightGBM or XGBoost classifier on the flattened mel features or those reduced by pooling. The requirements specify using LightGBM with CPU only, while XGBoost supports GPU, but since it’s not available, CPU XGBoost should work fine. With around 65k samples and 64*100 features (about 6400 dimensions), it may be heavy but manageable. Alternatively, I can compute 20 MFCC coefficients along with deltas to aggregate statistics over time.**Creating train dataframe and silence samples**\n\nI need to implement a process to build a training dataframe and a function for loading background noise to create silence samples. The next steps will be to set the AUDIO_DIR to train/audio, list the class directories with their wav counts, and determine mappings for target and unknown labels. I'll also include background noise files to generate silence samples, initially setting a silence ratio of 10% of the total target and unknown files, and prepare to sample segments for feature extraction. Finally, I’ll add the cell for building the dataframe.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 3,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Build train dataframe with 12-class mapping (targets, unknown, silence)\",\n      \"import glob, math, random, re\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"\",\n      \"ROOT = Path('.')\",\n      \"AUDIO_DIR = ROOT / 'train' / 'audio'\",\n      \"TEST_DIR = ROOT / 'test' / 'audio'\",\n      \"TARGET_WORDS = ['yes','no','up','down','left','right','on','off','stop','go']\",\n      \"BG_DIR = AUDIO_DIR / '_background_noise_'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def get_speaker_id_from_path(fp: Path) -> str:\",\n      \"    m = re.match(r'^(?P<spk>[^_]+)_nohash_', fp.stem)\",\n      \"    return m.group('spk') if m else fp.stem.split('_')[0]\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Enumerate class folders\",\n      \"class_dirs = [p for p in AUDIO_DIR.iterdir() if p.is_dir()]\",\n      \"class_names = sorted([p.name for p in class_dirs])\",\n      \"print('Class folders (train/audio):', class_names)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Split into targets, background, and non-target (unknown source)\",\n      \"bg_present = BG_DIR.exists()\",\n      \"non_target_classes = [c for c in class_names if c not in TARGET_WORDS and c != '_background_noise_']\",\n      \"print(f'Background present: {bg_present}; non-target classes (unknown sources): {len(non_target_classes)}')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Gather file paths\",\n      \"def gather_wavs(dirpath: Path):\",\n      \"    return sorted([Path(p) for p in glob.glob(str(dirpath / '*.wav'))])\",\n      \"\",\n      \"rows = []\",\n      \"for cls in TARGET_WORDS:\",\n      \"    cls_dir = AUDIO_DIR / cls\",\n      \"    for fp in gather_wavs(cls_dir):\",\n      \"        rows.append({'path': str(fp), 'label': cls, 'speaker': get_speaker_id_from_path(fp), 'kind': 'target'})\",\n      \"\",\n      \"for cls in non_target_classes:\",\n      \"    cls_dir = AUDIO_DIR / cls\",\n      \"    for fp in gather_wavs(cls_dir):\",\n      \"        rows.append({'path': str(fp), 'label': 'unknown', 'speaker': get_speaker_id_from_path(fp), 'kind': 'unknown'})\",\n      \"\",\n      \"df_train = pd.DataFrame(rows)\",\n      \"print('Train rows (target+unknown):', df_train.shape)\",\n      \"print(df_train.groupby('label').size().sort_values(ascending=False).head(15))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Build silence examples from background noise: create ~10% of train size\",\n      \"silence_rows = []\",\n      \"if bg_present:\",\n      \"    bg_files = gather_wavs(BG_DIR)\",\n      \"    # Some files in _background_noise_ are long; we'll sample random 1s offsets during feature extraction.\",\n      \"    n_silence = max(1, int(0.10 * len(df_train)))\",\n      \"    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)\",\n      \"    for i in range(n_silence):\",\n      \"        fp = bg_files[i % len(bg_files)]\",\n      \"        silence_rows.append({'path': str(fp), 'label': 'silence', 'speaker': f'silence_{i}', 'kind': 'silence', 'bg_index': i})\",\n      \"    print(f'Generated planned silence entries: {len(silence_rows)}')\",\n      \"else:\",\n      \"    print('Warning: _background_noise_ not found; no explicit silence examples will be created.')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"if len(silence_rows) > 0:\",\n      \"    df_sil = pd.DataFrame(silence_rows)\",\n      \"    df_train = pd.concat([df_train, df_sil], ignore_index=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('Final train rows (incl. silence if any):', df_train.shape)\",\n      \"print(df_train['label'].value_counts().head(15))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Test dataframe\",\n      \"test_files = sorted([Path(p) for p in glob.glob(str(TEST_DIR / '*.wav'))])\",\n      \"df_test = pd.DataFrame({'fname': [p.name for p in test_files], 'path': [str(p) for p in test_files]})\",\n      \"print('Test rows:', df_test.shape)\",\n      \"print(df_test.head())\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Save metadata for reuse\",\n      \"df_train.to_csv('train_meta.csv', index=False)\",\n      \"df_test.to_csv('test_meta.csv', index=False)\",\n      \"print('Saved train_meta.csv and test_meta.csv.')\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\"\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Training audio is under train/audio/<class>/*.wav.

    "llm_json": "**Extracting audio features**\n\nI’ve got the metadata ready. The next step is to perform feature extraction using log-mel with librosa or torchaudio on the CPU since the GPU isn’t available. I need to check if LightGBM is installed since we’ll rely on it for model training, or I could go with XGBoost. I also need to install librosa and soundfile, then implement a feature extractor function that loads WAV files, pads/trims them, and computes log-mel features. Normalization will be necessary to avoid leakage, but I’m considering the trade-off between accuracy and dimensionality.**Implementing feature extraction**\n\nI'm calculating that with around 64,073 samples and 6.4k features, I'll end up with a matrix size of 64073x6464, which is about 414 million floats—manageable at approximately 1.6 GB. Using XGBoost might be heavy on the CPU due to the density. I’m considering downsampling or computing statistics like mean or std. A small 1D CNN could work, but may be slow. I could also use sklearn's SGDClassifier on spectrograms, but I doubt it would medal. I’ll proceed to extract features into numpy arrays with per-utterance z-normalization.**Finalizing feature extraction and predictions**\n\nTypically, I want to avoid augmentation for features, but creating augmented duplicates might help with generalization, even if it takes time. I plan to implement basic log-mel features, flatten them, and then fit XGBoost with parameters like 500 trees, a max depth of 6, and an eta of 0.1, using early stopping with validation folds. I'll also need to ensure the label mapping matches the expected submission format and group by speaker ID, including handling silence data. Finally, I’ll save the features as npy files and remember to install librosa and soundfile.**Setting up model training**\n\nI need to create a cell for training using StratifiedGroupKFold with XGBoost. In this setup, I’ll log metrics for each fold, save the out-of-fold accuracy, and then make predictions for the test set by averaging the probabilities. However, I'll focus on implementing the feature extraction first, as that's the foundational step I need to complete before moving on to training the model.

It’s probably a good idea to log the process and consider expert review before diving into heavy code. Loading 64k files with librosa on CPU will likely take a long time, so I’m thinking of asking for advice on efficiency. The expert suggested precomputing mels to numpy. However, since our current code is single-threaded, it could drag on, so perhaps we should subsample first to test things out.**Modifying extraction parameters**\n\nI'm planning to modify the extraction cell to accept a limit parameter. This way, I can create a quick smoke extraction for 2000 training samples and 1000 test samples to validate the modeling code. Since I can only edit or execute in a single turn, it would be quicker to update the cell to include parameters like SAMPLE_TRAIN and SAMPLE_TEST for the subset. After validating, I’ll implement the model training, and later scale to full by setting those parameters to None.

Which gives best accuracy/speed tradeoff on CPU? 2) Recommend concrete hyperparams for XGBoost/CatBoost (depth, learning_rate, n_estimators, subsample, colsample) and whether to use multiclass softprob with early stopping, given ~64k rows and ~6k features if flattened. 3) Feature engineering: Should I keep flattened spectrograms or reduce via PCA (e.g., 256 comps) or pooling (per-mel mean/std/skew/kurt + a few spectral features like centroid/bandwidth/rolloff/ZCR)? What combo typically works best for KWS on CPU? 4) Silence handling: I created ~10% silence from _background_noise_. Is 10-15% optimal for boosting models as well? Any reweighting needed? 5) CV protocol: I\\u2019ll use StratifiedGroupKFold(5) with groups=speaker_id; any gotchas for the unknown/silence distribution to maintain per fold? 6) Inference: simple average of fold logits; any lightweight TTA we can do for boosting models (e.g., time shifts) and average probabilities without retraining?

Avoid flattened spectrograms.\n- If you can afford 2–4 hours on CPU: a tiny CNN on 2D log-mels (e.g., TC-ResNet8) typically hits 0.89–0.90 OOF and is still practical on CPU with torchaudio + multiprocessing.\n\n2) Concrete hyperparams (XGBoost/CatBoost)\n- XGBoost (recommended)\n  - objective=multi:softprob, num_class=12\n  - tree_method=hist, max_bin=256, n_jobs=-1\n  - max_depth=7–8\n  - eta=0.05\n  - n_estimators=1500–2000\n  - subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8\n  - min_child_weight=1–5, reg_alpha=0.0–0.1, reg_lambda=1.0–1.5\n  - eval_metric=mlogloss; early_stopping_rounds=50–100 on the fold’s val split\n- CatBoost (if you prefer)\n  - loss_function=MultiClass, depth=8, learning_rate=0.03, l2_leaf_reg=3.0\n  - iterations=3000–4000 with od_wait=200, bagging_temperature=0.5, subsample=0.8, rsm=0.8\n  - task_type=CPU\n\n3) Feature engineering (what to use on CPU)\n- Don’t use flattened spectrograms.\n- Use this compact set (≈400–720 dims):\n  - MFCC: n_mfcc=20–40; compute MFCC, Δ, ΔΔ; per-coef stats over time: mean, std (optionally min, max, skew, kurt). 20×3×2=120 dims (or up to 40×3×6=720 if you include all stats).\n  - Log-mel pooled stats: n_mels=64; per-mel mean, std, p25, p75 → 256 dims.\n  - Global spectral: centroid, bandwidth, rolloff(0.95), ZCR, RMS (each mean+std), spectral contrast mean (7) → ~17 dims.\n  - Optional: delta of log-mel mean/std across time (+2–4 dims).\n- Standardize features (z-score) per train fold; apply to val/test.\n- PCA not needed if you use the pooled/MFCC stats above.\n\n4) Silence handling\n- 10–15% silence is good. Use unique pseudo-speaker IDs for silence (e.g., silence_i).\n- Reweighting: usually not needed. If unknown dominates, either slightly downweight it (e.g., weight 0.8) or pass sample_weight from class-balanced weights.\n\n5) CV protocol\n- StratifiedGroupKFold(5) with groups=speaker_id and y as the final 12-class label (including unknown/silence) is correct.\n- Build unknown/silence before splitting.\n- Ensure silence has diverse pseudo-speakers to avoid fold leakage.\n\n6) Inference and TTA\n- Average fold probabilities.\n- Lightweight TTA without retraining: recompute features for 3–5 time shifts per clip (e.g., −160 ms, −80 ms, 0, +80 ms, +160 ms), predict with the trained model, average probs.\n\nConcise CPU recipe expected to reach ~0.89 OOF\n- Extraction (fast settings)\n  - Audio: 16 kHz mono; pad/crop to 1.0 s (random crop for train; center for val/test; random for silence entries).\n  - Log-mel: n_fft=512, hop=160, win=400, n_mels=64, fmin=20, fmax=8000; log(mel+1e-6).\n  - MFCC from the same filterbank: n_mfcc=20–40; compute Δ, ΔΔ.\n  - Features per file:\n    - MFCC(+Δ,+ΔΔ) stats: mean/std (optionally min/max/skew/kurt).\n    - Log-mel pooled stats per band: mean/std/p25/p75.\n    - Spectral descriptors: centroid, bandwidth, rolloff(0.95), ZCR, RMS (mean/std), spectral contrast mean (7).\n  - Parallelize extraction with joblib.Parallel or multiprocessing.Pool. If you switch to torchaudio transforms + multiprocessing, expect ~1.5–5× wall-time speedup vs single-process librosa.\n- Model: XGBoost with the params above; multiclass softprob; early stopping per fold.\n- CV: StratifiedGroupKFold(5), groups=speaker; fit scaler and model on the train split only; keep label order consistent with sample_submission.\n- Inference: average fold probs; add 3–5× time-shift TTA.\n\nExpected performance and practicality\n- MFCC(+Δ,+ΔΔ) + pooled log-mel stats + spectral + XGBoost(hist): ~0.885–0.900 OOF; trains in minutes per fold on CPU.\n- Time-shift TTA and mild class weighting/unknown downweighting typically add +0.003–0.01.\n- If you can run a tiny CNN on CPU (TC-ResNet8 on 2D log-mels), expect 0.89–0.90 OOF with simple time-shift aug; torchaudio + multiprocessing materially reduces wall time.\n\nConcrete parameters to paste (safe defaults)\n- XGBoost params:\n  - dict(objective='multi:softprob', num_class=12, tree_method='hist', max_bin=256, max_depth=8, eta=0.05, n_estimators=2000, subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8, min_child_weight=1, reg_alpha=0.0, reg_lambda=1.5, eval_metric='mlogloss', n_jobs=-1)\n  - early_stopping_rounds=100\n- Feature dims example (fast variant):\n  - MFCC 20 with Δ, ΔΔ (mean/std): 120\n  - Log-mel pooled (64×[mean,std,p25,p75]): 256\n  - Spectral/global: ~17\n  - Total ≈ 393 dims; z-score per fold.\n\nKey gotchas to fix in your notebook\n- Stop flattening log-mels for boosting. Build the pooled/MFCC feature table instead.\n- Keep silence samples with unique pseudo-speakers.\n- Ensure label mapping (10 targets + unknown + silence) is finalized before SGKF splitting.\n- Parallelize feature extraction; consider torchaudio+multiprocessing for a further 2–5× speedup on CPU.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: ship a working baseline now, enforce speaker-grouped CV, fix class balance, run strong augs/TTA, and ensemble lightweight models suited to your hardware.\n\nSynthesis of best advice\n- Validation and leakage (all coaches; critical):\n  - Use StratifiedGroupKFold on speaker_id (prefix before “_nohash_”). Fit any normalization on train-fold only. Track per-class metrics, esp. unknown/silence.\n- Features and normalization (blend of Grok/Claude/Openai):\n  - Use log-mel spectrograms (64–128 mels; fmin≈20, fmax=8k; hop≈160). Add a second config (e.g., 128 mels) for ensemble diversity.\n  - Prefer per-frequency CMVN computed on each train-fold (safer than pure per-utterance; preserves amplitude cues). If you keep per-utterance, compare CV; pick what wins.\n  - For silence, random 1 s crops from _background_noise_ at load time; keep ~5–15% of train.\n- Class handling (Openai priority, echoed by others):\n  - Unknown is overrepresented. Downsample unknown to ~1–2× a typical target or use class weights/balanced sampler. Keep silence ~10%.\n- Hardware-aware model choices (Claude/Openai; pragmatic):\n  - If GPU available: ResNet18/EfficientNet-B0 with augs, 5-fold CV, then add a second seed/model.\n  - If CPU-only: avoid heavy CNNs. Fastest medal path is YAMNet/VGGish embeddings + LogisticRegression/LightGBM/MLP; or a small DS-CNN/BC-ResNet-style KWS model. Both can hit ≥0.89 with good augs/TTA.\n- Augmentation and regularization (all coaches; key for +points):\n  - Time shift ±100–200 ms, speed 0.9–1.1x, background noise mix (SNR 5–20 dB), SpecAugment (time/freq masks). Optional light mixup α≈0.2–0.4. Label smoothing 0.05–0.1; dropout ~0.2.\n- Training strategy (all):\n  - AdamW, lr 1e-3–3e-3, cosine decay with warmup; early stopping (patience 5–10). Balanced batches. 20–30 epochs typically suffice.\n- Inference and ensembling (all):\n  - TTA: average logits over 3–5 time shifts/speed variants. Average across folds/seeds/models. Ensure label order matches 12-class list when mapping predictions.\n- Engineering hygiene (Grok + Claude/Openai):\n  - Cache features to .npy/.pt (float16 ok). Use efficient loaders. Verify submission format fname,label. Seed everything.\n\nConcise, actionable plan\n1) Decide hardware path:\n   - If GPU: proceed with ResNet18 baseline. If GPU=False, switch to YAMNet embeddings + LogisticRegression (or small DS-CNN).\n2) Finish full feature stage:\n   - Extract log-mels for train/test in two configs (64 and 128 mels). Implement per-fold per-frequency CMVN; compare vs per-utterance CMVN on 1 fold, keep the better.\n3) Fix labels and balance:\n   - Map non-targets to unknown; generate silence via random bg crops. Downsample unknown to ~1–2× per-target or use class weights/balanced sampler.\n4) Build robust CV:\n   - 5-fold StratifiedGroupKFold by speaker. Save OOF and per-fold test logits.\n5) Train baseline:\n   - GPU: ResNet18 (1ch input), augs (shift, speed, noise, SpecAugment), AdamW 3e-3 cosine 25–30 epochs, label smoothing 0.05, dropout 0.2.\n   - CPU: YAMNet/VGGish embeddings → LogisticRegression/LightGBM/MLP; or DS-CNN small with same augs and 20–30 epochs.\n6) Improve to medal:\n   - Add second feature config (128 mels) and/or second architecture (EfficientNet-B0 on GPU; or DS-CNN vs embeddings on CPU). Ensemble fold logits. Add TTA (3–5 shifts).\n7) Submit:\n   - Average logits across folds/models/TTAs; argmax to 12 classes. Ensure exact submission format and label order. Target OOF ≥0.89 before finalizing."

I’ll start by loading specific files: X_train_pooled.npy, y_train_pooled.npy, groups_pooled.npy, X_test_pooled_tta.npy, and test_fnames_pooled.csv. If any files are missing, I’ll raise an error message. \n\nI'll standardize using StandardScaler for each fold despite XGBoost not requiring it, as it could still help. For training, I'll utilize SGKF splits with XGBoost parameters and early stopping while logging metrics. \n\nThen, I'll predict on the test for each TTA shift! For consistency, I plan to fit the scaler on the training fold and apply it to the validation and test datasets while averaging over folds and TTA shifts. Finally, I’ll use DMatrix with scaled numpy arrays and ensure I have a class list to map indices to labels properly.**Finalizing submission process**\n\nI'm getting ready to write the submission.csv with all 6,473 files. However, I need to make sure that X_test_pooled_tta is correctly shaped as [n_shifts, N, D] and that I pull the test filenames from test_fnames_pooled.csv.

Any quick gains by adjusting min_child_weight (e.g., 3\\u20135), reg_alpha (0.1), reg_lambda (1.0), or switching eval to merror/accuracy for ES? 4) Normalization: We per-fold StandardScaler on pooled features.

Apply these immediately after the current run.\n\nPriority 1 — Fix the class imbalance (biggest gain; no re‑FE)\n- Use per‑fold sample weights. This keeps all data, handles the heavy unknown class, and is fastest to implement.\n- In Cell 7, inside the CV loop, right before creating DMatrix:\n  - from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_sample_weight\n  - sample_weight = compute_sample_weight('balanced', y=y[tr_idx])\n  - dtr = xgb.DMatrix(X_tr, label=y[tr_idx], weight=sample_weight)\n  - dva = xgb.DMatrix(X_va, label=y[va_idx])\n- If you prefer manual capped weights (alternative): compute class_counts = np.bincount(y, minlength=12); med = np.median(class_counts); w = np.clip(med/class_counts, 0.5, 2.0); sw = w[y]; then weight=sw[tr_idx].\n\nPriority 2 — Regularize XGBoost a bit more (consistent small gains)\n- Update params in Cell 7:\n  - max_depth=7\n  - min_child_weight=3 or 4\n  - reg_alpha=0.1\n  - reg_lambda=1.0\n  - keep: eta=0.05, subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8, tree_method='hist', max_bin=256\n- Keep eval_metric on 'mlogloss' for early stopping stability. Log and report accuracy per fold as you already do.\n\nPriority 3 — Tame outliers cheaply\n- After scaling in Cell 7:\n  - X_tr = np.clip(X_tr, -5, 5)\n  - X_va = np.clip(X_va, -5, 5)\n  - Apply the same clip to test TTA features after transform.\n\nPriority 4 — Slightly richer test‑time TTA (cheap)\n- Rerun Cell 6 with tta_shifts_ms=[-160, -80, 0, 80, 160] (5 shifts). No train re‑FE needed.\n- Average across the 5 shifts per fold as you already do.\n\nWhat not to change now\n- Features: Don’t double dims with skew/kurt; at most add MFCC min/max later if you’re chasing tiny gains.\n- Normalization: Keep StandardScaler; no log1p.\n- Silence: 10% is fine; 12% is also OK but won’t move much—don’t rework mid‑run.\n\nRecommended weights vs downsampling\n- Prefer sample weights now (faster, no resampling). If you later try downsampling, cap unknown to ~2× the average per‑target count (~4–5k total) and keep silence ~10–12%.\n\nExpected lift and pivot rule\n- With weights + params + clipping + 5‑shift TTA: expect +0.03–0.06 over your current fold0, typical 5‑fold OOF ≈0.86–0.88 (best‑case ~0.89).\n- If final 5‑fold OOF <0.86, pivot to a tiny CNN on 64‑mel spectrograms (e.g., TC‑ResNet8 with time shift + SpecAugment, CPU‑friendly). That path reliably reaches ≥0.89.\n\nConcrete Cell 7 diff (summary)\n- Compute sample_weight per fold and pass to DMatrix(train only).\n- params: max_depth=7, min_child_weight=3–4, reg_alpha=0.1, reg_lambda=1.0.\n- After scaler.transform: clip to [-5, 5] for train/valid/test.\n- In Cell 6: set tta_shifts_ms to [-160, -80, 0, 80, 160] and rerun test FE.\n\nImplement these first; they’re the quickest path to pushing OOF toward ≥0.88 with your current setup.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Pivot from pooled-stats-only to spectrogram CNNs (even on CPU with precomputed features), keep strict speaker-grouped CV, use strong augmentations, and ensemble. Submit a quick baseline now, then iterate toward ≥0.89 OOF.\n\n- Priorities\n  - Submit immediately: run your pooled-feature XGBoost training (cell 7) to get a baseline.\n  - Set medal target: OOF ≥0.89. If OOF <0.88, pivot to CNN on log-mels with ensembling.\n\n- Data and preprocessing (keep; they’re correct)\n  - Labels: 10 commands + unknown + silence. Map all non-target folders to unknown. Silence = random 1s crops from _background_noise_ (~5–15% of train).\n  - Audio: 16 kHz mono, 1s fixed length (pad/crop). Use random offsets for long clips/silence.\n  - CV: StratifiedGroupKFold with speaker_id; fit normalization per train-fold only (no global stats).\n  - Class balance: prevent unknown from dominating (downsample to ~1–2x per-keyword or use class weights).\n\n- Augmentations that move the needle\n  - Time shift ±100–200 ms; background noise mixing (SNR 0–20 dB) for keywords; speed 0.9–1.1x; volume jitter ±10 dB.\n  - For spectrogram models: SpecAugment (time/freq masks), mixup α≈0.2–0.4. Optional pitch ±2 semitones.\n  - TTA at test: multiple time shifts (and optionally slight speed).\n\n- Modeling paths\n  - Fast baseline (now; may reach ~0.86–0.89):\n    - Keep pooled features you built. Train XGBoost + add LightGBM + CatBoost on same features; average probabilities.\n    - Boost features: multiple mel configs (64 and 128 mels; 10 ms and 20 ms hop), add pooled deltas, skew/kurtosis, spectral contrast, maybe CQCC; train per-config models and ensemble.\n    - Hyperparam tune (Optuna) and ensemble seeds.\n  - Recommended for bronze+ (even on CPU):\n    - Precompute log-mel spectrograms to disk; train a lightweight 2D CNN (MobileNetV2/ResNet18) on CPU with small batches, 20–30 epochs, AdamW, cosine LR, label smoothing 0.05–0.1, dropout ~0.2. Early stop on val acc. Train 5 folds; average logits.\n    - If too slow, try a small 1D CNN or CRNN. Depthwise-separable convs help on CPU.\n  - Advanced bump (if time):\n    - Ensemble multiple backbones/configs/seeds. Pseudo-label high-confidence test preds and retrain.\n\n- Validation, inference, and analysis\n  - Monitor OOF confusion (on/off, go/no typical); target augmentations at confused pairs.\n  - Use per-fold normalizers; cache features to avoid I/O bottlenecks.\n  - Use TTA averaging for test predictions; ensure exact submission label set/order.\n\n- Actionable summary\n  1) Run cell 7; submit baseline.\n  2) Train LightGBM and CatBoost on current pooled features; average with XGBoost; resubmit.\n  3) Add a second pooled-feature set (e.g., 128 mels, 20 ms hop) and ensemble across feature configs and seeds; expand TTA shifts.\n  4) If OOF <0.88, pivot: precompute log-mels and train a lightweight CNN on CPU with SpecAugment + mixup; 5-fold, TTA; ensemble 1–2 seeds.\n  5) Rebalance unknown (downsample or class weights); verify silence sampling randomness; double-check no leakage.\n  6) Iterate via error analysis; add pseudo-labeling if close to threshold.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-22 05:27:58] Cell 7 has been executing for 310s and is still executing.

Our out-of-fold score of 0.838 is under the medal threshold, but the leaderboard status is still unclear. While I still have time to iterate, it doesn't seem the user is asking for a submission just yet. I think it would be wise to request an expert review to improve further since our OOF score isn't high enough. Implementing an ensemble with CatBoost and LightGBM could help boost the performance!**Implementing feature adjustments**\n\nI'm considering a second configuration for pooled features, like using 128 mel bands with 40 MFCCs. However, our extraction code is currently set to 64 mel bands. To address this, I could duplicate cell 6 and adjust the parameters, but I need to ensure we can override N_MELS and N_MFCC effectively. It seems like modifying the function would allow that. Once that's set, I can produce a new output prefix 'pooled128'. \n\nAlso, I can quickly train a CatBoost model using existing features and average it with the predictions saved in test_pred_pooled.npy. I think adding a cell for CatBoost training with the same settings will help improve the score a bit. I'll need to install CatBoost too!**Setting up CatBoost training**\n\nI'm planning to create a training loop for CatBoost that utilizes sample weights for handling multiclass data. I’ll make sure to set the loss function to 'MultiClass' and use the same pipeline, even though standardization isn't strictly necessary. I already have X_test_tta loaded from cell 7, but I’ll reload it for the new cell 8.\n\nIn this new cell, I’ll load pooled features and the test TTA, set up SGKF with 5 folds, and train CatBoost with appropriate parameters like learning rate and depth. It might take some time, especially with 3000 iterations and 5 folds, but I’ll implement early stopping to prevent excessive training. Finally, I’ll predict probabilities for validation and test datasets, average them out, and compute OOF accuracy to blend with the saved XGBoost predictions.**Finalizing OOF predictions**\n\nI realize we need out-of-fold (OOF) predictions to compute a combined OOF, but we didn't save the OOF for CatBoost yet.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a focused, medal‑oriented plan synthesized from all four reviews, tailored to your current pipeline and CPU limits.\n\n1) Blending\n- Do both, fast:\n  - Alpha sweep on OOF probs: blend = (1−α)XGB + αCB, α ∈ {0.00…1.00 step 0.05}. Cheap, robust baseline.\n  - LogisticRegression stacker on OOF probs with SGKF meta‑CV (same groups): LR(multi_class='multinomial', solver='lbfgs', max_iter=2000). Features = concat probs [XGB, CB] (24 dims). Typically +0.002–0.01 vs fixed α. Use the meta‑CV to avoid leakage.\n- If CB > XGB by >0.02 OOF, bias α toward CB (≈0.6–0.7) if you need a quick single‑number blend.\n\n2) CatBoost params (CPU, numeric features)\n- Strong, fast setting (keep your SGKF, per‑fold scaling/clipping/weights):\n  - depth=8\n  - learning_rate=0.05\n  - l2_leaf_reg=1.0–6.0 (start at 1.0)\n  - iterations=3000–5000 with od_type='Iter', od_wait=200–300\n  - bootstrap_type='Bernoulli', subsample=0.8, rsm=0.8\n  - random_strength=0.1–1.0 (start 0.1)\n  - border_count=128\n- Optional second seed for diversity: depth=6, lr=0.06, l2=8, iterations=4000, bagging_temperature=0.5, rsm=0.9.\n- No need to switch grow_policy now; symmetric trees are fast and solid.\n\n3) Feature additions (high yield, CPU‑cheap)\nAdd once, retrain all boosters. Prioritize:\n- MFCC higher‑order stats: skew, kurtosis for MFCC/Δ/ΔΔ (+≈120 dims if n_mfcc=20).\n- MFCC min/max per coef (+40 dims).\n- Spectral flatness mean/std (+2).\n- RMS percentiles p10/p90 (+2).\n- Log‑energy/RMS dynamics: simple global slope (mean_last20% − mean_first20%) (+1).\n- Optional (after above): chroma_stft mean/std (+24). Tonnetz = low priority.\nThese typically add ~0.01–0.02 OOF across boosters.\n\n4) Class handling\n- Keep compute_sample_weight('balanced') per fold.\n- Minor tweaks to test if confusion shows imbalance issues:\n  - Slightly upweight silence: w[silence] *= 1.2, or\n  - Cap unknown: w[unknown] *= 0.8 to reduce overdominance.\nChoose one based on OOF confusion; default balanced is usually fine.\n\n5) Validation\n- Your StratifiedGroupKFold by speaker_id and 12‑class mapping with generated silences mirrors LB well. Good.\n- Pitfalls: ensure each silence has unique pseudo‑speaker_id (you do), per‑fold StandardScaler only, and label order matches submission.\n\n6) TTA\n- 5 time shifts is a good sweet spot. You can shift to ±200 ms: [-200, -100, 0, 100, 200] (often slightly better than ±160).\n- Optional tiny add: 1 extra noisy pass (≈30 dB SNR) at inference for +0.001–0.003. Skip pitch/time‑stretch for pooled stats unless you’re still short.\n\n7) Next model for diversity (CPU)\n- Add LightGBM; it blends very well and is fast.\n  - Option A (standard, faster):\n    objective='multiclass', num_class=12, metric='multi_logloss',\n    learning_rate=0.05, num_leaves=31–63, max_depth=7,\n    feature_fraction=0.8, bagging_fraction=0.8, bagging_freq=1,\n    min_data_in_leaf=20–50, lambda_l1=0–0.1, lambda_l2=1.0, n_jobs=-1, seed=42,\n    early_stopping_rounds=100, n_estimators up to 2000.\n  - Option B (DART for more diversity): boosting='dart', drop_rate≈0.1, max_drop≈50.\n- Optional quick extra diversity: LogisticRegression baseline on standardized features (multinomial); weak alone, but adds small ensemble gain.\n- ExtraTrees only if you have spare time; usually weaker/slower here.\n\nOrdered next steps (max OOF gain per time)\n1) Let CB finish. Save OOF/test probs.\n2) Blend:\n   - Alpha sweep on OOF for XGB+CB; submit best.\n   - Train LR stacker on OOF probs with SGKF meta‑CV; submit if it beats alpha.\n3) Add features: MFCC skew/kurt + min/max + flatness + RMS p10/p90 + slope. Re‑extract once.\n4) Retrain XGB and CB with the above CB params. Re‑blend (alpha and LR stacker). Submit.\n5) Train LightGBM (standard or DART). Add to blend/stacker [XGB, CB, LGB]. Submit.\n6) If confusion shows issues: try silence +20% weight or unknown ×0.8. Keep the better.\n7) Optional: adjust TTA shifts to ±200 ms; add 1 noisy pass if still marginal.\n\nExpected gains\n- CB tuned vs your baseline: +0.01–0.02 OOF.\n- Feature additions: +0.01–0.02.\n- LGBM add + blending/stacking: +0.01–0.02.\n- Combined: should lift from 0.838 to ≈0.88–0.89 OOF (bronze range).\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: fix the LB/CV mismatch first, then calibrate/ensemble, and pivot to spectrogram CNNs if time allows.\n\nPriority 0 — submission and evaluation hygiene (immediate)\n- Verify exact 12-class mapping and submission label order:\n  - Labels must be: yes,no,up,down,left,right,on,off,stop,go,unknown,silence; strings must match sample_submission exactly.\n  - Rebuild submission by mapping argmax indices to this ordered list; ensure all test rows are present and only these labels appear.\n- Check “unknown” and “silence” sources:\n  - Map all non-target folders to unknown; generate silence only from _background_noise_ random 1s crops.\n- Use StratifiedGroupKFold by speaker_id for all CV (you already do) and fit scalers on train-fold only.\n\nPriority 1 — close the LB gap and gain quick points (today)\n- Run CatBoost and blend with existing XGBoost (Cell 8). Tune blend weight alpha on OOF.\n- Add LightGBM (hist) on the same pooled features; blend all three. Then stack with a ridge/logistic meta-learner on OOF probs.\n- Rebalance training rows (works better than weights alone):\n  - Downsample unknown to ~1–2x the average per target class; target silence share ~15–20%.\n- Calibrate priors and post-process:\n  - Optimize a per-class logit bias vector on OOF to maximize accuracy; add to test logits before argmax.\n  - Add a silence override rule tuned on OOF: if RMS_mean < τ and ZCR < ζ, predict silence.\n  - Unknown bias/threshold: prefer unknown when max prob < θ or add positive bias to unknown.\n- Expand TTA: 9–11 time shifts (e.g., ±400ms in 80ms steps) and average probabilities.\n\nPriority 2 — strengthen CPU features and diversity (next 24–48h)\n- Add 2–3 feature views and train a model per view:\n  - Mel configs: n_mels=128; vary fmax (6–8 kHz), window/hop.\n  - Temporal stats: skew/kurtosis for log-mel/MFCC; delta/delta-delta for spectral descriptors; band energy ratios; chroma/tonnetz.\n- Offline augmentation for GBMs (generate extra rows, then re-extract pooled stats):\n  - Time shifts, background mixing (SNR 5–20 dB), slight speed (0.95–1.05), gain jitter.\n- Feature selection sanity (optional speed): SelectKBest to 200–300 dims; compare.\n\nPriority 3 — pivot to spectrogram CNNs for medal ceiling (parallel or after above)\n- If GPU available, fix CUDA; if not, use a small CPU-friendly CNN.\n- Precompute and cache log-mel spectrograms (64–128 mels). Train a lightweight 2D CNN (e.g., ResNet18/EfficientNet-B0) with:\n  - Augmentations: time shift, background noise mixing, SpecAugment, mixup; 20–40 epochs; AdamW + cosine LR; label smoothing.\n  - SGKF by speaker_id; fold-average logits and TTA at inference.\n- Even 1 small CNN blended with your GBMs typically reaches ≥0.8879.\n\nChecks and common pitfalls to avoid\n- Submission hygiene: fname,label columns only; no extra whitespace/case mismatches.\n- Class imbalance: don’t let unknown dominate; downsample rows and tune unknown bias.\n- Silence prevalence: public test often has more silence; the detector/bias helps LB correlation.\n- Don’t iterate on tree hyperparams endlessly; ensembling, calibration, rebalancing, and better features move the needle more.\n\nMinimal execution plan\n1) Execute Cell 8 (CatBoost), blend with XGB; add LightGBM and re-blend; stack on OOF probs.\n2) Implement per-class bias tuning + silence override + unknown bias; re-submit.\n3) Expand TTA and add at least one extra FE view; train additional GBMs; re-blend/stack.\n4) Start spectrogram CNN training (CPU if needed) and blend with GBMs.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-22 05:56:54] Cell 8 has been executing for 131s and is still executing.

Confirm priority and exact list/order to ship first iteration fast.\\n2) CatBoost tuning: swap to depth=8, lr=0.05, l2_leaf_reg=1.0, od_type=Iter, od_wait=250\\u2013300, border_count=128, random_strength=0.1; keep subsample/rsm=0.8, Bernoulli. Worth retrain now? Any tweaks on CPU to close gap to XGB/LGB?\\n3) LightGBM tuning: current hist baseline params. Should we try DART variant for diversity (drop_rate\\u22480.1, max_drop\\u224850) or adjust num_leaves/min_data/l2 to target accuracy? Provide a compact param set.\\n4) Class handling/calibration: Implement per-class bias optimization on OOF logits to maximize accuracy before argmax, plus optional unknown/silence bias and a simple silence override using RMS/ZCR thresholds. Which order and typical magnitudes (e.g., bias range, threshold heuristics)?\\n5) Data rebalancing: Instead of only sample_weight, downsample unknown to ~1\\u20132x per-target and set silence ~15\\u201320% of train. Would you do this with current pooled features? Any pitfalls with SGKF consistency?\\n6) TTA: Move shifts to \\u00b1200ms ([-200,-100,0,100,200]) or expand to ~9\\u201311 shifts up to \\u00b1400ms? Any benefit for these pooled stats on CPU?\\n7) Additional models for diversity: After features+tuning, add DART-LGB and a second-seed XGB/CB? Anything else CPU-friendly worth it?\\n8) Submission hygiene: Labels order is correct. Any other common gotchas for this competition we should safeguard (e.g., silence prevalence in public LB) that bias tuning should reflect?\\n\\nGoal: reach \\u22650.8879 (bronze). Please provide a concrete step-by-step priority list for the next 3\\u20135 hours, with specific params and expected \\u0394OOF per step. We'll implement immediately.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the fastest, medal-focused plan synthesized from all audits, tailored to your current pipeline and results. Implement in order; ship a submission after Phase 2.\n\nPriority plan (next 3–5 hours)\n\nPhase 1 — Cheap global lift (high ROI; 30–45 min)\n1) Feature bundle (implement now)\n- Add (in this order): MFCC/Δ/ΔΔ per-coef skew, kurtosis, min, max; spectral flatness mean/std; RMS p10/p90; energy slope (last 20% − first 20%); optional chroma_stft mean/std.\n- Keep all current features; just extend.\n- TTA shifts: change test shifts to [-200, -100, 0, 100, 200] ms.\n- Expected ΔOOF: +0.012–0.022 features, +0.001–0.003 TTA.\n\nMinimal spec for the additions:\n- MFCC extras: for mfcc, mfcc_d, mfcc_dd (N_MFCC=20), compute per-coef skew, kurt, min, max and concat.\n- Spectral flatness: mean, std of librosa.feature.spectral_flatness.\n- RMS percentiles: 10th, 90th from librosa.feature.rms.\n- Energy slope: mean(rms last 20%) − mean(rms first 20%).\n- Optional chroma: chroma_stft mean/std (12×2).\n\nPhase 2 — Fix CatBoost + add LGB diversity (biggest model ROI; ~1.5–2.0 h)\n2) CatBoost retrain (your weakest link)\n- Use: depth=8, learning_rate=0.05, l2_leaf_reg=1.0, iterations=4000, od_type='Iter', od_wait=250–300, border_count=128, bootstrap_type='Bernoulli', subsample=0.8, rsm=0.8, random_strength=0.1, random_seed=42, thread_count=-1.\n- Keep your per-fold StandardScaler, clipping [-5,5], and balanced weights.\n- Expected ΔOOF (CB): +0.010–0.020; improves blend a lot.\n- If overfitting or unstable, fallback: depth=6, l2_leaf_reg=5.0, iterations=2000, od_wait=150 (slightly more regularized).\n\n3) LightGBM DART variant (for diversity; fast)\n- params_dart:\n  - objective='multiclass', num_class=12, metric='multi_logloss', boosting='dart'\n  - learning_rate=0.05, num_leaves=63, max_depth=7\n  - feature_fraction=0.8, bagging_fraction=0.8, bagging_freq=1\n  - drop_rate=0.1, max_drop=50, skip_drop=0.5\n  - min_data_in_leaf=30, lambda_l2=1.0, seed=42, n_jobs=-1\n- Keep your baseline LGB too; train both on the new features.\n- Expected ΔOOF (ensemble lift): +0.005–0.010.\n\n4) Blend weights sweep\n- 3-way simplex sweep with step=0.05–0.1 on OOF for (XGB, CB, LGB) and optionally include DART as 4th model (coarse sweep).\n- If CB improves >0.82 OOF, typical starting weights ~ (0.35, 0.30, 0.35); if CB stays <0.82, downweight CB ~(0.45, 0.10, 0.45).\n- Expected ΔOOF: +0.005–0.010.\n\nPhase 3 — Cheap calibration/heuristics (very high ROI per minute; 10–20 min)\n5) Per-class bias on blended OOF logits\n- Optimize additive biases per class on OOF logits (coordinate descent or Powell) to maximize OOF accuracy before argmax.\n- Practical grid: [-1.0, 1.0] step 0.05; start near 0.\n- Typical moves: unknown negative (≈ −0.2..−0.6), silence slightly positive (≈ +0.1..+0.5); others small.\n- Apply same biases to test logits before argmax.\n- Expected ΔOOF: +0.003–0.010.\n\n6) Silence override (tiny, safe gain)\n- If top_prob < 0.40 AND rms_mean < 0.010 AND zcr_mean < 0.05 → force silence.\n- Use your pooled rms/zcr features (pre-scaler values mirrored through your per-fold scaler consistently).\n- Expected ΔOOF: +0.001–0.004; aligns with silence-heavy public LB.\n\nIf time remains (30–45 min)\n7) Second seeds for diversity\n- Retrain second-seed XGB (seed=202) and LGB (seed=202). Re-blend.\n- Expected ΔOOF: +0.002–0.005.\n\nDe-prioritize for now (unless CV stalls <0.86 after Phase 2)\n- Data rebalancing: Risky with SGKF; your balanced sample_weight is safer. If you must, lightly downsample unknown to ~1.5× average target and set silence ≈18%—but regenerate groups and re-extract to keep consistency. Expected gain uncertain (+0.0–0.01), so skip until after above steps.\n- Expanding TTA to 9–11 shifts: negligible on pooled stats; skip.\n\nAnswers to your numbered questions (concise)\n1) Features: Yes, ship full bundle now in order: MFCC skew/kurt/min/max → spectral flatness mean/std → RMS p10/p90 → energy slope → chroma mean/std (optional). Expected +0.01–0.02 OOF.\n2) CatBoost: Retrain now with depth=8, lr=0.05, l2_leaf_reg=1.0, iterations=4000, od_wait=250–300, border_count=128, random_strength=0.1, subsample/rsm=0.8. If still lagging, try depth=6, l2=5.0, iterations=2000. Aim to close gap to ≥0.82 OOF.\n3) LightGBM: Keep your baseline GBDT and add a DART model:\n   - DART compact set as in Phase 2 (above).\n   - Mild accuracy-targeting tweak set (if not using DART): learning_rate=0.03, num_leaves≈95, min_data_in_leaf=20, lambda_l1=0.1, lambda_l2=0.5.\n4) Class handling/calibration: Do per-class bias after choosing the best blend. Grid [-1,1] step 0.05; unknown usually negative, silence slightly positive. Then add the silence override with RMS/ZCR thresholds. Bias first, override second.\n5) Data rebalancing: Skip for now. If you test it later, keep SGKF groups intact, and re-extract features to avoid leakage/mismatch.\n6) TTA: Use 5 shifts at [-200,-100,0,100,200]. More shifts bring negligible gain on pooled stats.\n7) Additional models: After features+tuning, add LGB-DART and second seeds for XGB/LGB. That’s the best CPU-friendly diversity.\n8) Submission hygiene: Label order already correct. Public LB often has higher silence; your bias and silence override account for this. Average across folds and TTA before calibration; apply biases to logits and then argmax. Keep per-fold scaler/train-only fitting and clipping consistent.\n\nConcrete 3–5 hour schedule and expected gains (stacked)\n- 0:00–0:40 Add features + switch TTA shifts; re-extract; quick XGB/LGB/CB retrains start → +0.013–0.025\n- 0:40–2:10 CatBoost tuned retrain → +0.010–0.020\n- 2:10–2:30 LightGBM DART retrain → +0.005–0.010 (ensemble)\n- 2:30–2:40 Blend weight sweep (3–4 models) → +0.005–0.010\n- 2:40–2:55 Per-class bias + silence override → +0.004–0.014\n- 2:55–3:40 If time: second seeds (XGB/LGB) + re-blend → +0.002–0.005\n\nExpected trajectory: 0.839 → ~0.875–0.895 OOF (bronze range). Submit after Phase 3 even if seeds aren’t done.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: pivot to a CPU-feasible CNN on log-mel spectrograms, fix the submission bug now, and enforce rock-solid validation/label handling. Then train a lightweight, well-augmented model and ensemble.\n\nPriority fixes (today)\n- Fix LB 0.252 immediately:\n  - Verify submission columns exactly [fname,label] with labels from the 12-class set; fname order must match sample_submission.\n  - Ensure class index ↔ label mapping is identical across train/OOF/test/inference.\n  - Inspect test predictions’ label distribution (no single-class collapse like unknown/silence).\n  - Re-run inference-only and resubmit to confirm.\n- Sanity checks:\n  - 1.0s, 16 kHz mono for all clips; no background_noise files mapped to unknown; silence generated only from _background_noise_ with random 1s crops.\n  - Per-fold scalers/normalization applied to val and test (no leakage).\n\nCore strategy (all three coaches agree)\n- Use a small CNN on log-mel spectrograms (works on CPU; pooled stats + GBDTs cap around ~0.84 OOF).\n- Keep StratifiedGroupKFold by speaker_id; maintain strict 12-class mapping; control unknown/silence balance.\n\nCPU DL plan (fast, medal-capable)\n- Precompute features to disk (float16):\n  - Log-mels: n_mels 64–128, hop ~10 ms, win ~25 ms, fmin ~20, fmax ~8k.\n  - Optional channels: Δ, ΔΔ (1–3 channels total).\n  - Normalization: per-fold CMVN (per-frequency); no global stats.\n- Model options (adapt first conv to 1–3ch):\n  - Tiny-ResNet18 or MobileNetV2 (depthwise separable), or a small CRNN. Add dropout (0.2–0.5), global avg pool, 12-class head.\n- Training:\n  - 5-fold SGKF. AdamW (lr 1e-3–3e-3, wd 1e-4), cosine schedule with warmup, label smoothing 0.05–0.1. 20–35 epochs, early stop on val acc.\n  - Batch 16–32; enable MKL/MKLDNN; prefetch DataLoader; cache spectrograms.\n  - Class balance: per-batch balanced sampling or loss weights; silence ~8–12% of train; generate fresh silence crops per epoch.\n- Augmentations (key to reach ≥0.88):\n  - Time shift ±80–160 ms; background noise mixing (SNR 5–20 dB).\n  - SpecAugment (2× time masks ~24 frames; 2× freq masks ~8–12 mels).\n  - Mixup α 0.2–0.4; light speed perturb 0.9–1.1 (apply before mel).\n- Inference/TTA:\n  - Average logits across folds and 3–7 time shifts; optional light noise mixes.\n\nEnsembling\n- Train 2–3 seeds and/or a second mel config (e.g., 64 vs 96/128 mels); average logits.\n- Optionally blend CNN ensemble with your current XGB/LGB/CB for a small lift.\n\nIf you must stay CPU-ML briefly (stopgap)\n- Preserve temporal structure: frame-level sequences with simple 1D CNN or temporal pyramid pooling on mel/MFCC; add chroma/tonnetz, onset, modulation spectrogram features. Expect incremental gains only.\n\nMinimal timeline\n- Next 1–2 hours: fix submission/label mapping; verify distributions; resubmit.\n- Next 0.5 day: precompute log-mels (+Δ/+ΔΔ), implement tiny-ResNet/MobileNetV2, run 1–2 folds to time check.\n- Same day: full 5-fold, TTA, submit; iterate with a second seed/mel config; ensemble.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Stop using pooled stats as primary; keep them only for blending.\n- Precompute log-mels (+Δ/+ΔΔ), train a small CNN with SGKF-by-speaker, strong augmentations, class balance, per-fold CMVN.\n- Average folds + TTA; ensemble 2–3 seeds/configs; optionally blend with current GBDTs.\n- Double-check submission format and label index/order consistency to eliminate the LB anomaly."

    "llm_json": "**Updating feature extraction**\n\nI need to make sure to import `skew` and `kurtosis` from `scipy.stats`. If SciPy isn't installed, it can come via `librosa` dependencies, which is convenient. I'll also need to modify the `extract_feature_vector` in cell 6 and tweak the `run_pooled_feature_extraction` call to use the new shifts of `[-200, -100, 0, 100, 200]`, replacing the earlier shifts. Finally, we should save the new arrays, overwriting the existing files to ensure everything functions smoothly when we re-run cell 6 and retrain the models.**Calculating RMS percentiles and features**\n\nI'm looking at the RMS percentiles, which may have a shape of `(1, T)`, so it looks like `rms[0]` will be my vector sequence. I need to compute `np.percentile(rms, [10,90])` along the time axis, ensuring to flatten it. For the energy slope, I’ll split the data, calculating the mean of the last segment minus the mean of the first. \n\nFor the chroma features, I'll use `librosa.feature.chroma_stft`, averaging across time for the 12 bins, which adds 24 dimensions. I’ll also consider updating the default `tta_shifts_ms` parameter in the function calls. Let's get these changes implemented!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 6,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# CPU-friendly pooled feature extraction (MFCC+\\u0394+\\u0394\\u0394 stats, log-mel pooled stats, spectral descriptors) with parallelism\",\n      \"import sys, subprocess, os, time, math, numpy as np, pandas as pd\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"from joblib import Parallel, delayed\",\n      \"import multiprocessing as mp\",\n      \"\",\n      \"try:\",\n      \"    import librosa, soundfile as sf\",\n      \"except Exception as e:\",\n      \"    print('Installing librosa & soundfile...', e)\",\n      \"    import sys\",\n      \"    subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '--quiet', 'librosa==0.10.1', 'soundfile==0.12.1', 'numba==0.59.1'], check=True)\",\n      \"    import librosa, soundfile as sf\",\n      \"\",\n      \"from scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis\",\n      \"\",\n      \"SR = 16000\",\n      \"N_MELS = 64\",\n      \"N_FFT = 512\",\n      \"WIN_LENGTH = 400\",\n      \"HOP_LENGTH = 160\",\n      \"FMIN, FMAX = 20, 8000\",\n      \"EPS = 1e-6\",\n      \"FIX_DURATION = 1.0\",\n      \"N_MFCC = 20\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def load_audio_fixed(path: str, shift_samples: int = 0, rng: np.random.Generator | None = None) -> np.ndarray:\",\n      \"    y, sr = librosa.load(path, sr=SR, mono=True)\",\n      \"    target_len = int(FIX_DURATION * SR)\",\n      \"    # Apply shift (positive -> right, negative -> left) by padding and slicing\",\n      \"    if shift_samples != 0:\",\n      \"        if shift_samples > 0:\",\n      \"            y = np.pad(y, (shift_samples, 0))\",\n      \"        else:\",\n      \"            y = np.pad(y, (0, -shift_samples))\",\n      \"        start = max(0, 0)  # we'll crop below\",\n      \"    # Pad/crop to 1s\",\n      \"    if len(y) < target_len:\",\n      \"        y = np.pad(y, (0, target_len -

So, I’ll proceed to edit cell 8.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 8,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# CatBoost on pooled features + blend with XGBoost; SGKF, weights, clipping, 5-shift TTA\",\n      \"import os, time, numpy as np, pandas as pd, sys, subprocess\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedGroupKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\",\n      \"from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_sample_weight\",\n      \"\",\n      \"try:\",\n      \"    from catboost import CatBoostClassifier, Pool\",\n      \"except Exception as e:\",\n      \"    print('Installing catboost...', e)\",\n      \"    subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '--quiet', 'catboost==1.2.5'], check=True)\",\n      \"    from catboost import CatBoostClassifier, Pool\",\n      \"\",\n      \"CLASSES = ['yes','no','up','down','left','right','on','off','stop','go','unknown','silence']\",\n      \"num_class = len(CLASSES)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"train_feat = 'X_train_pooled.npy'\",\n      \"train_y = 'y_train_pooled.npy'\",\n      \"train_groups = 'groups_pooled.npy'\",\n      \"test_feat_tta = 'X_test_pooled_tta.npy'\",\n      \"test_fnames_csv = 'test_fnames_pooled.csv'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"assert os.path.exists(train_feat) and os.path.exists(train_y) and os.path.exists(train_groups), 'Missing train pooled features'\",\n      \"assert os.path.exists(test_feat_tta) and os.path.exists(test_fnames_csv), 'Missing test pooled TTA features'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"X = np.load(train_feat)\",\n      \"y = np.load(train_y)\",\n      \"groups = np.load(train_groups)\",\n      \"X_test_tta = np.load(test_feat_tta)  #

It appears the order iterates through the shifts list, likely starting with 0 then +1600. That's alright, and we’ll wait for completion. After that, I should execute Cells 7, 8, and 10 sequentially. I’ll begin with LightGBM DART while retraining baselines for XGB and LGB. CatBoost may take longer due to tuned parameters!**Planning execution strategy**\n\nI’ll wait for Cell 6 to finish before executing Cell 7 (XGB), which took around 1271 seconds previously. In the meantime, I could consider soliciting expert review, but I've already done that. It might be helpful to add a new DART cell to run later. I'll create Cell 12 to train LGBM DART using the same pipeline and save the OOF/test arrays. Once Cell 6 completes, I'll run Cells 7, 10, 8, and 12, then update blending to include DART. Let's insert Cell 12 now!**Creating DART cell**\n\nI’m planning to craft code similar to Cell 10, but I’ll add `boosting='dart'` along with the relevant parameters. I want to save the outputs to `oof_pooled_lgb_dart.npy` and `test_pred_pooled_lgb_dart.npy`, and I’ll include callbacks for better handling.

    "llm_json": "**Planning model execution steps**\n\nI need to determine our next tool actions. First, Cell 7 is running XGBoost with new features. Once it finishes, I plan to run the tuned CatBoost in Cell 8, then the LGB-DART in Cell 12. After that, I’ll create an updated blending cell for all four models, including bias tuning. While Cell 7 runs, I can prep the blending cell and ensure I'm reading the latest OOF numpy files, optimizing for accuracy with a coarse simplex grid.**Implementing bias adjustments**\n\nI need to handle probabilities, not logits here. We usually apply the bias additively to logits, but since I have probabilities, I can convert these using the logit function. By adding the bias in log space, it’s akin to multiplying the probabilities. I’ll take the logs, ensuring to clip them to be greater than zero, and then apply the bias vector to the log probabilities. For testing, the same biases will be used. \n\nI plan to implement a function that tunes the biases, adjusting them in small increments while limiting the range. Also, I note that the silence override requires features we didn’t store, but I can approximate using averaged features.**Identifying feature indices for computation**\n\nI need to compute the rms_mean and zcr_mean from the spec_desc features within the feature vector. First, I’ll map these features to their corresponding indices. The feature vector is ordered as follows: 256 for logmel_stats, 120 for mfcc_stats, 240 for mfcc_extras, and 15 for spec_desc. \n\nBased on this structure, I've determined that rms.mean is the 8th entry in the spec_desc, which gives it an index of 624, while zcr.mean has an index of 622. However, I notice that the inference relies on blended probabilities rather than the direct features.**Implementing silence override strategy**\n\nTo apply the silence override, I can load the X_test_pooled_tta.npy, which has a shape of (5, N, D), and average across shifts. This will allow me to check the thresholds using the relevant feature columns. \n\nIn the blending cell, after creating the final predicted probabilities, I’ll apply per-class biases based on out-of-fold data to optimize. For the silence override, I'll calculate X_test_raw_avg and load the thresholds (tau = 0.010, zeta = 0.05). I'll set samples with top_prob < 0.40 to the silence class. We might also explore a logistic regression stacker after phase 2 blending for simplicity.**Implementing Cell 13 code**\n\nI’m ready to implement the code for Cell 13. First, I’ll load the available out-of-fold and test arrays for the models. \n\nNext, I’ll build candidate blends, adjusting for the presence of DART. I plan to perform a 4-way grid search over various weights, making sure the sum is less than or equal to 1. \n\nFor bias tuning, I’ll transform the out-of-fold probabilities to log, add the bias vector, and compute accuracy while clamping the values. For the test predictions, applying the biases will be straightforward. I'll compute silence override by averaging features from the test dataset and then setting the appropriate predicted labels.

Target is medal range ASAP.\\n2) LightGBM DART: Worth running with current params for diversity on CPU? Any quick param tweaks (drop_rate/max_drop/skip_drop) you recommend to maximize diversity without tanking accuracy? Or should we prefer a second XGB seed instead?\\n3) Blending strategy: We plan a coarse simplex grid blend across XGB/CB/LGB/(LGB-DART if trained), then per-class bias tuning in log space, then a silence override rule using pooled features (rms_mean<0.010, zcr_mean<0.05, top_prob<0.40).

Or should we lock features now and focus on ensembling?\\n5) If CB continues ~16 min/fold (~80\\u201390 min total), do you advise running LGB-DART in parallel (separate process) or wait to keep memory/IO predictable? We have 36 vCPUs, 440GB RAM.\\n\\nGoal: Hit \\u22650.896 OOF blended to secure silver, ideally push \\u22650.905 if possible. Please advise whether to continue CB as-is, adjust, or reallocate time to LGB-DART and additional XGB/LGB seeds. Also validate our CV protocol (StratifiedGroupKFold by speaker_id) and TTA shifts [-200,-100,0,100,200] as representative for test conditions.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Fast path to silver (and a shot at 0.905):\n\n1) CatBoost runtime vs payoff\n- Let CatBoost finish all 5 folds as-is. Fold 0=0.8978 is ensemble-valuable; ~80–90 min total is worth it.\n- Optional time saver (only if you must): iterations=3000, od_wait=150–200, l2_leaf_reg=3–5. Otherwise keep current depth=8, lr=0.05, Bernoulli 0.8.\n- If later folds degrade by >0.01 vs XGB, you can stop after 3 folds and blend with partial OOF (use rows with OOF for all models when tuning weights), but prefer full OOF with your time budget.\n\n2) LightGBM DART\n- Yes, run for diversity now, on CPU, in parallel with CatBoost. Quick, stable params:\n  - boosting='dart', drop_rate=0.10, max_drop=50, skip_drop=0.5\n  - lr=0.05, num_leaves=63, max_depth=7, feature_fraction=0.8, bagging_fraction=0.8, bagging_freq=1, min_data_in_leaf=30, lambda_l2=1.0, seed=42.\n- DART adds more diversity than a second XGB seed; if time remains after blending, add a second XGB seed as an extra +0.002–0.005.\n\n3) Blending and calibration\n- Do a coarse simplex grid on OOF probs (step=0.1), then refine around the best with step=0.05.\n- Per-class additive bias in log space: 2–3 passes, steps (0.2→0.1→0.05), clamp |bias|≤1.0. Typical moves: unknown −0.2…−0.6; silence +0.1…+0.4. Expected gain: +0.003–0.008 OOF.\n- Silence override: your thresholds are sensible:\n  - rms_mean<0.010, zcr_mean<0.05, top_prob<0.40\n  - Optional quick sweep: top_prob {0.35,0.40,0.45}, rms_mean {0.008,0.010,0.012}, zcr_mean {0.04,0.05,0.06}.\n- Temperature scaling: not needed for argmax accuracy. If curious, a light global T=1.1–1.3 after bias is optional; don’t overfit here.\n- Indices check: zcr_mean_idx=622, rms_mean_idx=624 are correct.\n\n4) Features\n- Lock the 662-dim set. New features now are low-ROI vs. ensembling/calibration. If you must add one tiny thing later, spectral kurtosis percentiles (p25/p75) can occasionally help, but skip for the medal push.\n\n5) Parallelism and resources\n- Run LGB-DART now in a separate process. With 36 vCPUs/440 GB RAM you’re safe.\n- Split threads to avoid contention: CatBoost thread_count≈18, LightGBM num_threads≈18 (or set LGB n_jobs=16 if simpler).\n- Keep per-fold StandardScaler and clipping exactly as in current cells.\n\n6) Execution order (minimal wall time)\n- Continue CatBoost to completion.\n- Start LGB-DART now in parallel (Cell 12) with the params above and limited threads.\n- When both finish, run the 4-model blend (Cell 13): coarse grid → bias tuning → silence override → submission.\n- If blended OOF <0.896, train a second XGB seed and reblend; otherwise submit and, if time, add seeds for a final push.\n\n7) Expectations\n- XGB 0.8903 + LGB 0.8865 + CB (≈0.89 OOF) + DART diversity + bias + override:\n  - +0.005–0.010 from CB diversity\n  - +0.003–0.005 from DART\n  - +0.003–0.005 from bias/override\n  - Target blended OOF ≈0.898–0.905 (silver likely; 0.905 possible).\n\n8) Protocol validation\n- StratifiedGroupKFold by speaker_id: correct; keep.\n- TTA shifts [-200, -100, 0, 100, 200] ms: representative and good for pooled features.\n\nIn short: let CatBoost finish, launch LGB-DART now, blend with coarse grid + per-class bias, apply your silence override, and add an extra XGB seed only if needed. This gets you to silver quickly with upside toward 0.905.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: fix the submission/pipeline gap first, then finish the 4-model ensemble and apply calibrated post-processing.\n\nImmediate fixes (highest ROI)\n- Correct TTA shifts: use [-50, -25, 0, 25, 50] ms (not ±200 ms) for 1s clips to avoid brittle predictions.\n- Validate submission strictly:\n  - Labels exactly in {yes,no,up,down,left,right,on,off,stop,go,unknown,silence}; no casing/trailing spaces.\n  - submission.csv must contain all 6473 fnames exactly once and match sample_submission order via inner join check.\n  - Ensure predictions use the final pooled features and full test set (delete any stale submission.csv).\n- Sanity checks:\n  - Quick train-as-test smoke: accuracy > 0.7 on a held-out train slice to catch mapping/normalization bugs.\n  - Inspect submission label distribution; if 70%+ are silence/unknown, adjust thresholds/rules.\n\nModel/ensemble plan (you’re already on track)\n- Keep 662-dim pooled features + StratifiedGroupKFold with speaker grouping, fold-wise scaling, clipping, and class-balanced weights.\n- Train/retain:\n  - XGBoost (strong, OOF ~0.8903)\n  - LightGBM GBDT (OOF ~0.8865)\n  - CatBoost (tuned; adds diversity)\n  - LightGBM-DART (diversity)\n- Blend:\n  - Start with 3-way weights near (XGB, CB, LGB) ≈ (0.4, 0.2, 0.4) from OOF sweep; add DART and re-sweep simplex.\n  - Average logits across models and TTA shifts.\n  - If needed, try LR stacker on OOF probs, but prefer weight blend if OOF is higher.\n\nCalibration and post-processing\n- Per-class bias tuning on blended OOF logits; apply to test logits to correct prior mismatches (especially unknown/silence).\n- Silence override: if max_prob < 0.4 AND low energy (e.g., RMS mean < 0.01) AND low ZCR (< 0.05), force label = silence.\n- Optional “unknown” threshold: if max_prob < ~0.35, assign unknown (tune on OOF).\n\nFeature/augmentation hygiene\n- Maintain 1s, 16kHz mono; per-utterance or fold-only normalization (no global stats).\n- Class imbalance: use balanced sample weights per fold.\n- Augmentations/TTA: small time shifts (±50 ms). If time allows, light noise mix or speed 0.95–1.05x.\n\nDiagnostics and safeguards\n- Reconcile CV vs LB: after fixes, your OOF ~0.89 should translate to bronze+; if not, re-check label mapping, normalization parity train/test, and TTA pipeline.\n- Watch overfitting: if blending doesn’t improve OOF, increase regularization or reduce model/depth.\n\nMinimal actionable checklist\n1) Regenerate test TTA features with shifts [-50,-25,0,25,50].  \n2) Retrain/finish CatBoost, LGB-DART; keep XGB/LGB results.  \n3) Blend 3–4 models (logits), bias-tune on OOF, apply silence override.  \n4) Rigorously validate submission format/content and resubmit.  \n5) If LB still lags CV, tighten thresholds for silence/unknown and re-check normalization consistency.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-22 08:21:42] Cell 8 has been executing for 1715s and is still executing.

The most effective approach is to create a new file called `train_lgb_dart.py` that includes the code from Cell 12, then execute it in the next turn. To set this up, I’ll call the `create_file` tool to create an empty file, but then I’ll need to use `edit_file` to add content later. Alternatively, I could insert a new cell for execution using subprocess, but I can't modify cells during execution. For now, I'll focus on creating the file.**Analyzing feature extraction timing**\n\nI’ve computed features using TTA shifts of [-200, -100, 0, 100, 200]. If I change these, I’ll need to rerun the feature extraction, which took around 70 seconds for tests, and longer for training. The initial training was quite slow, probably several minutes. While changing TTA only impacts test features, I could quickly regenerate them with smaller shifts for later predictions. However, since the models are already trained, any changes would affect predictions made with the existing `X_test_pooled_tta.npy`.**Deciding on prediction process**\n\nSince the current CatBoost in cell 8 is using `X_test_pooled_tta.npy`, replacing it mid-run could be risky. It seems better to wait for CatBoost to finish, then regenerate and rerun predictions. Although I thought we'd need to refit models, the scaler is independent, fitted only on the training fold. So we could apply the models to new test features, but since they're not saved, I'd need to retrain. Thus, it’s impractical to change TTA shifts now; I’ll continue with the existing data and run LGB-DART as a separate script. I'll create it with the `edit_file` tool.**Planning file creation and execution**\n\nI’ve realized it’s safer to use `create_file` before `edit_file`, but I can only use one tool per turn. Maybe it’s best to execute code with the `execute_code` tool, specifying an action like \"execute,\" but it only runs notebook cells or scripts by their path, not arbitrary shell commands. So, my first step will be to create the file `train_lgb_dart.py`. I’ll work on creating that file now.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"create_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"train_lgb_dart.py\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Create a separate script to train LightGBM-DART in parallel with the ongoing CatBoost fold training, per expert advice. Next turn will populate the script with the code from Cell 12 (with limited threads to avoid contention) and then execute it as a separate process.\"\n}",

The plan is to prepare the final blending when both finish. I could try running notebook cell 13 now, but I need to make sure both predictions are saved first. Waiting a bit and checking progress sounds good, and maybe I'll adjust the TTA shifts to smaller values, but that might introduce risks. So I'll stick to the current plan for now.**Deciding on predictions**\n\nI need to rerun the `X_test_pooled_tta.npy` because CatBoost is currently using it for predictions after training. If I regenerate it now, it might create inconsistencies in the predictions across different folds. However, since test_blend averages these folds, it shouldn't matter too much, but it's best to avoid changes during this stage. It seems wiser to wait until CatBoost finishes before regenerating and running predictions. To keep things efficient, I’ll close open files and maybe choose to sleep for about 10 minutes. This should help me check the progress afterward.**Monitoring progress**\n\nI see that CatBoost takes about 16 minutes per fold, and right now, fold 1 is in progress, with about 10 more minutes to go. LGB-DART's fold 0 is running, and it looks like it'll take around 5 minutes per fold. I think I’ll set a 10-minute sleep timer and check on things then. If the code finishes earlier, that's perfectly fine; the sleep will just end early. I'll make sure to include an explanation of what I’m doing for clarity!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"sleep\",\n  \"sleep_payload\": {\n    \"sleep_duration_minutes\": 10\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"CatBoost fold 1 and LGB-DART fold 0 are in progress.

    "llm_json": "**Considering model retraining options**\n\nI’m weighing whether we should rerun model training or write separate code to refit scalers and retrain. It feels like a heavy lift. An alternative is to regenerate pooled test features under a new name with small shifts and fit a StandardScaler on the entire training data. However, that could introduce leakage across folds. We need model objects to predict, but we can't recompute model predictions without retraining, making it a bit tricky.**Evaluating retraining options and thresholds**\n\nI’m considering retraining only XGB and LGB with new test features for updated predictions, while CB and DART would still use old features, which might lead to inconsistencies in blending weights. However, this might still work. Following the \"Independent coach\" checklist, I need to validate submission format and sanity checks. Our final silence override applied to zero samples; maybe the thresholds are too strict. I could sweep thresholds and biases, using OOF approximation for quick parameter adjustments with triplet combinations. Plus, I see we have the necessary saved features for calculations.**Exploring threshold tuning options**\n\nI’m realizing our code uses averaged X_test_pooled_tta, and we could do something similar with X_train_pooled. We don't have train TTA, but maybe we can estimate thresholds by applying them to validation data. The override mask relies on top_prob from blended out-of-fold predictions and feature values from training features. I’ll modify Cell 13 to perform a threshold grid search using training data without TTA. I’ll compute the mask and override blended predictions where necessary, and then apply the best thresholds to the test set. This could improve accuracy!**Enhancing cell for tuning**\n\nI’m planning to edit cell 13 to incorporate OOF-driven silence override tuning and a finer grid search before executing. My first step is to modify the cell using a tool, and I need to load X_train_pooled.npy to compute zcr_mean and rms_mean for training, applying the same indices as in the test. After conducting coarse blend and bias tuning, I’ll calculate OOF top_prob. Next, I’ll grid search the thresholds, producing new prediction labels and tracking the best thresholds. Finally, I’ll apply this process to the test set using X_test_avg!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 13,\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# 4-model blend (XGB, CB, LGB, LGB-DART) with per-class bias tuning and silence override + threshold sweep\",\n      \"import os, time, numpy as np, pandas as pd\",\n      \"from itertools import product\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\",\n      \"\",\n      \"CLASSES = ['yes','no','up','down','left','right','on','off','stop','go','unknown','silence']\",\n      \"num_class = len(CLASSES)\",\n      \"EPS = 1e-8\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def coarse_simplex_blend(oofs, tests, step=0.1):\",\n      \"    names = list(oofs.keys())\",\n      \"    K = len(names)\",\n      \"    best = {'acc': -1.0, 'w': None, 'order': names}\",\n      \"    grid = np.arange(0.0, 1.0 + step/2, step)\",\n      \"    if K == 2:\",\n      \"        for a0 in grid:\",\n      \"            a1 = 1.0 - a0\",\n      \"            w = np.array([a0, a1])\",\n      \"            o = sum(w[i]*oofs[n] for i,n in enumerate(names))\",\n      \"            acc = accuracy_score(y, o.argmax(1))\",\n      \"            if acc > best['acc']:\",\n      \"                best = {'acc': acc, 'w': w.copy(), 'order': names}\",\n      \"    elif K == 3:\",\n      \"        for a0, a1 in product(grid, grid):\",\n      \"            if a0 + a1 <= 1.0 + 1e-12:\",\n      \"                a2 = 1.0 - a0 - a1\",\n      \"                w = np.array([a0, a1, a2])\",\n      \"                o = sum(w[i]*oofs[n] for i,n in enumerate(names))\",\n      \"                acc = accuracy_score(y, o.argmax(1))\",\n      \"                if acc > best['acc']:\",\n      \"                    best = {'acc': acc, 'w': w.copy(), 'order': names}\",\n      \"    else:\",\n      \"        for a0, a1, a2 in product(grid, grid, grid):\",\n      \"            s = a0 + a1 + a2\",\n      \"            if s <= 1.0 + 1e-12:\",\n      \"                a3 = 1.0 - s\",\n      \"                w = np.array([a0, a1, a2, a3])\",\n      \"                o = sum(w[i]*oofs[n] for i,n in enumerate(names))\",\n      \"                acc = accuracy_score(y, o.argmax(1))\",\n      \"                if acc > best['acc']:\",\n      \"                    best = {'acc': acc, 'w': w.copy(), 'order': names}\",\n      \"    tb = sum(best['w'][i]*tests[n] for i,n in enumerate(best['order']))\",\n      \"    ob = sum(best['w'][i]*oofs[n] for i,n in enumerate(best['order']))\",\n      \"    return best, ob, tb\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def tune_biases_greedy(log_oof, y, steps=(0.2, 0.1, 0.05), clamp=1.0, max_passes=3):\",\n      \"    b = np.zeros(log_oof.shape[1], dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"    best_acc = accuracy_score(y, (log_oof + b).argmax(1))\",\n      \"    for step in steps:\",\n      \"        improved = True\",\n      \"        passes = 0\",\n      \"        while improved and passes < max_passes:\",\n      \"            improved = False\",\n      \"            passes += 1\",\n      \"            for c in range(log_oof.shape[1]):\",\n      \"                for delta in (-step, step):\",\n      \"                    old = b[c]\",\n      \"                    b[c] = np.clip(b[c] + delta, -clamp, clamp)\",\n      \"                    acc = accuracy_score(y, (log_oof + b).argmax(1))\",\n      \"                    if acc > best_acc + 1e-9:\",\n      \"                        best_acc = acc\",\n      \"                        improved = True\",\n      \"                    else:\",\n      \"                        b[c] = old\",\n      \"    return b, best_acc\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Load available OOF/test predictions\",\n      \"need = ['oof_pooled.npy','oof_pooled_cat.npy','oof_pooled_lgb.npy','test_pred_pooled.npy','test_pred_pooled_cat.npy','test_pred_pooled_lgb.npy','y_train_pooled.npy','test_fnames_pooled.csv']\",\n      \"have_all = all(os.path.exists(p) for p in need)\",\n      \"if not have_all:\",\n      \"    print('Required base predictions missing.

Though I'm hesitant, since the last submission didn’t medal, I might consider making a small adjustment to TTA shifts, which will require some additional work, like regenerating test features.**Deciding on next submission steps**\n\nI realize that to produce test predictions, we already saved the test_pred arrays from training. However, if we regenerate test features with new TTA, it’s tricky since we can’t recompute predictions without the necessary models or scalers. I could consider adjusting silence override thresholds to see if that improves the outcome on tests. While the OOF sweep didn’t help, there’s potential with unknown thresholds. Perhaps a different blending of weights is worth exploring.

Training with 662 dimensions is taking about 35 minutes. I can also train another XGB with a different seed and some variations. Adding a second seed to LGB is quick and can add diversity too.

I should create a new cell to train XGB with a different seed and perhaps tweak some parameters.

    "llm_json": "**Addressing model improvement**\n\nAlright, I've executed the blend cell, but now I see that the out-of-fold (OOF) accuracy is 0.89691, which is slightly lower than the previous 0.89698. Since there's no improvement, I need to address the gap between cross-validation and leaderboard scores. \n\nThe next step involves regenerating test TTA features with specific shifts. I’ll modify cell 6 to run the feature extraction function, being careful to use max_train=None just to regenerate test features. A small helper function would help streamline this process.**Generating test features and predictions**\n\nI think I could add a new cell to compute only the test features using the existing feature extraction function. It might be simpler to create a quick cell that loads test_meta.csv, iterates through the shift list, and generates features using a parallel pattern. \n\nNow, I need to figure out how to re-run predictions for each model since we haven't saved them. Although the models weren't saved, we can use the test predictions generated earlier from prior inference with TTA. However, for new predictions, I'd have to recompute using the models during training folds, and they aren't persisted.**Recomputing test predictions**\n\nI’m considering an alternative approach where I could average the out-of-fold (OOF) weights and apply them to the new feature-based silence override. But wait, the test predictions depend on features, and since the tree models were trained on those features, I'd need to recompute them by running the models again.\n\nHowever, we didn’t save the models, which means retraining would be required. The instructions suggest that retraining isn’t necessary, just re-running predictions. It seems I can't easily handle tree models like XGB, LGB, or CatBoost without saved models or scalers. I’ll need a different strategy.**Considering prediction adjustments**\n\nI'm wondering if there's a way to recompute new test features and adjust predictions without rerunning the models. Unfortunately, it seems not feasible. Instead, I could implement post-hoc calibration using TTA features for the silence override, but I already worked on the silence override. The TTA shifts might be causing issues, and changing the TTA features only impacts the override step.\n\nGiven the constraints and lack of time, it may be best to consult an expert about whether to proceed with a resubmission or regenerate test TTA and recompute predictions quickly. However, since retraining took hours, I think we should just go ahead and submit the current submission.csv.**Planning next steps for predictions**\n\nIt seems the earlier submission had a similar out-of-fold (OOF) score of 0.89698 but did not win a medal, and unfortunately, my current OOF is even slightly lower. The goal is still to aim for a medal, so I could consider adjusting TTA and recomputing predictions with a quicker method. \n\nSince boosting models are deterministic, I can reproduce them with the same seeds and fewer rounds, but that’s time-consuming! Maybe I should just recompute test predictions for the XGB and LGB models and blend those with the already computed DART and XGB2 on the old TTA. Given the focus is to improve the leaderboard score, I think I should seek expert advice on the best approach to close the gap without retraining. So, I'll request an expert review, providing the notebook path and my question.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"We fixed the dynamic K-model blend in Cell 13 and produced a 5-model blend. Result: Coarse OOF 0.89640; after per-class bias tuning, OOF 0.89691. Submission.csv saved. However, our previous best OOF 0.89698 did not medal on LB, likely due to test TTA shifts (+/-200ms) being too aggressive. Next step per guidance is to regenerate ONLY test TTA features with smaller shifts ([-50, -25, 0, 25, 50]) and rerun predictions WITHOUT retraining. Problem: we did not persist trained models or scalers. Our current pipeline computes test preds during each training fold; we only saved OOF and test prob arrays, not the models. We can regenerate X_test_pooled_tta.npy easily, but cannot recompute test predictions for each model without retraining. Question: What is the fastest medal-path now? Options: (1) Recompute only test TTA features and re-run fast models to regenerate test predictions: XGB (35 min) + LGB (5\\u20136 min) + LGB-DART (similar to LGB, maybe 6\\u20138 min); skip CatBoost (too slow). Then reblend 4-models with the new test preds and old OOF (OOF remains same). Is mixing OOF from old TTA with test preds from new TTA acceptable for blend weight selection and bias tuning? (We use OOF only to set weights/biases; test preds can be from different TTA). (2) Alternatively, update only the silence-override stage by regenerating X_test_pooled_tta.npy with small shifts and recomputing zcr/rms/top_prob thresholds; leave base test probs unchanged. Is this likely to help LB meaningfully? (3) Any other low-cost post-processing you recommend (e.g., class-wise temperature scaling using OOF, pred clipping caps, unknown/silence priors) that typically boosts LB for this competition? Please advise the minimal-time plan to reach a medal under CPU-only constraints and existing artifacts.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the fastest, low-risk path to a medal under CPU-only and your current artifacts:\n\nPrimary fix: reduce test-time shift range\n- Regenerate ONLY test pooled TTA with small shifts [-50, -25, 0, 25, 50]; save as X_test_pooled_tta_small.npy (and test_fnames_pooled_small.csv). Do not touch train features/OOF.\n\nPlan A (fast, ~1.2–1.3h wall time)\n- Re-run fast boosters to rebuild test preds against the new small-TTA features (keep the exact training data/OOF; only swap the test loader):\n  - LightGBM (~6 min), LightGBM-DART (~6–8 min), XGB seed1 (~35 min), XGB seed2 (~35 min).\n  - Save outputs with suffixes (e.g., test_pred_pooled_lgb_tta50.npy).\n- Important: Do NOT keep CatBoost’s old test preds in the final blend. Either:\n  - Retrain CatBoost on small-TTA (adds ~1.8h; see Plan B), or\n  - Exclude CatBoost from the final blend to avoid a CV/LB mismatch (OOF-driven weights won’t detect CB’s degraded test-TTA).\n- Blend and post-process:\n  - In your blend cell, include only models with refreshed small-TTA test preds. Use existing OOF for weight search and your per-class bias tuning (mixing old OOF with new test preds is fine).\n  - Recompute the silence-override thresholds on OOF as you already do; then apply on test using the average of the small-TTA pooled features. If the sweep gives no OOF lift, slightly relax thresholds: top_prob 0.45, rms 0.012, zcr 0.06.\n- Submit.\n\nPlan B (slower, higher probability, ~3.5h)\n- Same as Plan A but also rerun CatBoost on small-TTA and include it in the blend. This is best if CB previously had large weight (you saw ~0.5). Also add saving of per-fold models/scalers going forward.\n\nQuick notes\n- Mixing OOF (unchanged) with new small-TTA test predictions is acceptable because OOF is used only for weights/biases.\n- Option 2 (silence-override only) won’t fix the TTA-induced distribution shift; skip as a standalone fix.\n- Other post-proc: your per-class bias tuning is already the main win. Temperature scaling won’t help accuracy. If public LB seems silence-heavy, a tiny positive silence bias after tuning is okay if OOF stays flat. Optional 5% prior nudging toward OOF class priors can help stabilize: test = 0.95*test + 0.05*oof_prior.\n\nSanity check (optional, quick)\n- Compare entropy across TTA shifts for a few models; large variance indicates unstable TTA. Small-shift TTA should reduce it.\n\nExecution order\n1) Build small-shift test TTA. 2) Retrain LGB, LGB-DART, XGB, XGB2 pointing to the small TTA; save new test preds. 3) Exclude CB unless you also rerun it with small TTA. 4) Reblend, bias-tune, apply silence override using small-TTA pooled features. 5) Submit.\n\nExpected outcome\n- Closing the aggressive TTA gap typically recovers ~0.005–0.015 on LB, which should push you into medal range given your OOF.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: close the CV↔LB gap first, then tighten calibration and blending.\n\n1) Fix test-time setup (highest ROI)\n- Regenerate test pooled features with small TTA only: shifts in ms [-50, -25, 0, 25, 50] (or try [-40, 0, 40], then no TTA if needed). Do not retrain; just re-run predictions for XGB/CB/LGB/LGB-DART/XGB2 and re-blend.\n- Keep train features unchanged; avoid large test shifts (±100–200ms) on 1s clips.\n\n2) Blending and calibration (use OOF to tune, then apply to test)\n- Ensure K-agnostic simplex blending over all available models (XGB, CB, LGB, LGB-DART, XGB2). Run a coarse simplex (step 0.1), then a fine local search (step 0.02–0.05) around the best weights; use OOF accuracy as the objective.\n- Apply per-class bias tuning in log-space (greedy small steps, clamp ≈±1.0); keep if OOF improves ≥0.001.\n- Post-process with two low-cost overrides tuned on OOF:\n  - Silence override: if top_prob < tp AND rms_mean < r_thr AND zcr_mean < z_thr → silence. Sweep tp∈[0.35–0.45], r_thr∈[0.008–0.012], z_thr∈[0.04–0.06].\n  - Unknown override: if top_prob < tp AND rms_mean ≥ rmin AND zcr_mean ≥ zmin → unknown. Sweep tp∈[0.45–0.55], rmin∈[0.008–0.010], zmin∈[0.05–0.06].\n- Prefer simple weighted averaging over stackers unless stacker OOF clearly wins.\n\n3) Sanity checks (cheap, critical)\n- Validation: StratifiedGroupKFold by speaker_id; print unique speakers per fold to confirm no leakage.\n- Submission: exact 12-class label strings; 6473 rows matching sample_submission; no NaNs; sensible class distribution (notably some unknown and silence present).\n- Preprocessing consistency: identical scaling per fold; no global stats; same mel/centering between train/test.\n\n4) If LB still lags after steps 1–3\n- Reduce/disable TTA entirely and resubmit; excessive averaging over shifts can hurt tabular features.\n- Light rebalancing + mild train-time augmentation (then retrain GBDTs):\n  - Under-sample unknown to ~2–3× a typical keyword; keep some added silence from background noise.\n  - When extracting train pooled features, add a small random crop/shift for robustness.\n- Add modest model diversity (e.g., another CatBoost with different depth/lr) only if it improves OOF.\n\n5) Pivot only if necessary\n- If the gap persists and LB < ~0.88, train a tiny 2D CNN on 64-mel spectrograms (few epochs, CPU-friendly), then blend with the tree ensemble for better generalization on unknown/silence.\n\nActionable one-pass plan\n- Rebuild X_test_pooled_tta with [-50,-25,0,25,50] ms.\n- Re-run test predictions for all trained models; K-agnostic simplex blend; apply bias tuning.\n- Add silence + unknown overrides from OOF-tuned thresholds; submit.\n- If LB < CV by >0.03: try smaller/zero TTA; then apply rebalancing + light train-time shift and retrain GBDTs."

    "llm_json": "**Planning test computation**\n\nI want to add a new cell to compute test data using small shifts and save the results. This involves creating cell 15, which will execute a function to handle the test while utilizing features defined previously, like in cell 6. It seems those functions persist in Jupyter notebooks, so calling them should work smoothly. After setting up this new cell, I’ll rerun the training cells to generate predictions and ensure everything is modified appropriately for the output files.**Modifying prediction process**\n\nI think the easiest option is to duplicate the prediction loop using a new test path, making minimal changes by temporarily renaming variables like test_feat_tta and test_fnames for the new file. However, adding variants of those cells or creating a small script to load out-of-fold (OOF) data might be better. The models should retrain in their respective cells, but I realize that will take about 1.2 to 1.3 hours. I need to adjust specific cells to use small test time augmentation (TTA) while ensuring the OOF stays comparable.**Inserting test feature generation**\n\nI’ve decided to leave the current structure as is and just create new files for test predictions without altering the out-of-fold (OOF) files. However, the existing code in those cells also recomputes the OOF during training, which saves to files like oof_pooled*.npy.

Excluding CatBoost caused the previous blend's OOF to drop, but it looks like the LB gap has been fixed. Should we resubmit? Even though we already submitted and didn’t medal, we might need to include CatBoost with a small TTA by regenerating its test predictions without retraining, but that takes time. I’ll plan to rerun CatBoost with small TTA and adjust the blend fine-search step as needed. Let's modify the CatBoost cell accordingly and execute it.**Editing model parameters**\n\nI need to start by editing cell 8 to switch it over to a small TTA and save the file as *_tta50.npy. Once that's done, I can proceed to execute the cell. It feels straightforward, but I want to make sure I don’t miss any details. Let’s focus on getting this step right before moving on to anything else!

Any regularized multinomial calibration that beats our LR stacker (which underperformed here)?\\n- TTA: use 3 shifts ([-40,0,40] ms) or different aggregation (geometric mean) across shifts/models?\\n- Post-processing: better silence/unknown heuristics (e.g., thresholds using RMS/ZCR/spectral flatness) known to help on this comp?\\n- Additional quick-win models on CPU: sklearn ExtraTrees/HistGBDT, Ridge multinomial on standardized features, or QDA/LDA on selected MFCC stats? Which adds diversity here?\\n- Feature tweaks: any high-signal additions for 1s commands to add quickly (e.g., pitch/tonnetz, delta on chroma, entropy measures) that are CPU-cheap and typically help?\\n- Any known label mapping quirks for this comp (e.g., adjust silence proportion) that improve LB stability?\\n\\nGoal: Next 1\\u20133 hours implement the highest-ROI steps to achieve \\u22650.89627 LB (silver) or \\u22650.88793 (bronze). Please prioritize the safest LB-positive tactics with minimal training time and advise exact changes to our blending/calibration and TTA strategy.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: You’re already at medal-quality; the gap is from the final blending/calibration choices and small CV overfit. Do the following, in order, with minimal retraining and highest LB safety.\n\nPriority 0: Consistency check (you likely already did this)\n- Use only the refreshed small-TTA test preds for all models (you now have XGB, LGB, LGB-DART, XGB2, CB aligned). Good.\n\nSubmission 1 (robust, fastest): Remove overfitting in the final step\n- Keep your current 5-model small-TTA ensemble but:\n  - Disable per-class bias tuning and the silence override (they’re OOF-tailored; your sweep applied to 0 samples anyway).\n  - Blend via power-weighting in probability space for robustness (no grid search):\n    - Compute each model’s OOF accuracy; set weight w_i ∝ (acc_i)^4; normalize to sum 1.\n    - Blend test = Σ w_i · probs_i. Argmax for labels.\n- Submit. This has the highest probability to close the CV/LB gap without overfitting.\n\nSubmission 2 (usually +0.002 to +0.005): Geometric (log-space) blending with light refinement\n- Keep the same models/preds.\n- Blend in log-space (geometric mean across models): logits = Σ w_i · log(clip(p_i, 1e-9, 1)); argmax of logits.\n- Find w by:\n  - Start from power-weights above.\n  - Do 2–3 passes of coordinate descent on weights with step 0.02 around the start point (renormalize to simplex each trial), accepting only OOF accuracy improvements. No per-class biases, no silence override.\n- Submit. This is safer on LB than linear prob blends and often bumps accuracy slightly.\n\nIf you need one more nudge (optional, quick):\n- Conservative silence adjustment (post-blend), tiny and global:\n  - Multiply silence probability by 1.03–1.05, renormalize. Keep it fixed (no OOF search).\n- Or global temperature on logits: divide logits by T in {1.05, 1.10}; keep only if OOF improves. Avoid classwise temps.\n\nOptional add-on diversity (15–30 min total) if you still need lift:\n- Train ExtraTrees on pooled features (fast, CPU-friendly, adds bagging diversity):\n  - n_estimators=600, max_depth=None, min_samples_leaf=2, max_features='sqrt', class_weight='balanced', n_jobs=-1, random_state=42.\n  - Per-fold StandardScaler+clip as with boosters; SGKF; predict test on the mean of small-TTA features.\n  - Add its OOF/test preds to the blend and re-run Submission 2 procedure.\n- If time remains: HistGradientBoostingClassifier (scikit-learn) with loss=log_loss, learning_rate≈0.06, max_depth=7, max_leaf_nodes=63, l2_regularization=0.1, max_bins=255, random_state=42. Blend similarly.\n\nAnswers to your specific questions (succinct):\n- Logit vs prob blending, biases, temperature: Use log-space blending; avoid per-class biases for LB robustness. Global temperature only if it improves OOF; classwise temps/Platt/isotonic are slower and mainly calibration, not top-1 accuracy (if you do try calibration, isotonic per class via SGKF is the safest).\n- Weight search: Power-weighting is robust; if refining, use coordinate descent with 0.02 steps. Avoid fold-wise weight aggregation (leakage risk/complexity).\n- Calibration: Skip complex calibrations now. If you must, classwise isotonic via SGKF can add ~0.001–0.003, but keep it simple to avoid overfit.\n- TTA: Your small shifts are fine; keep arithmetic or switch to geometric at the model-blend level (as above). Don’t regenerate per-model TTA now.\n- Post-processing: Disable the current silence override. If needed, apply only a tiny fixed silence boost (+3–5%) with renorm.\n- Extra CPU models: ExtraTrees (yes). HistGBDT (optional). Skip Ridge/QDA/LDA here.\n- Feature tweaks and label quirks: Skip for this push. Your 12-class mapping is standard; minor silence boost is enough.\n\nExecution checklist (1–3 hours):\n1) Submission 1 (power-weighted, no biases/override) → submit.\n2) Submission 2 (log-space blend + coord descent, no biases/override) → submit.\n3) If still short: add ExtraTrees, reblend with log-space method, and submit.\nThese steps are the safest LB-positive moves to reach bronze/silver quickly on CPU-only.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Fix the submission pipeline first, then submit the strongest small‑TTA blend; pivot only if LB still lags.\n\nPriority 0 — Debug the 0.27 LB (before any new modeling)\n- Enforce row order: Build submission by merging predictions onto sample_submission.csv by fname; do not rely on any test_meta ordering.\n- Verify label mapping: Exactly 12 classes [yes,no,up,down,left,right,on,off,stop,go,unknown,silence], correct case/order, no extra spaces.\n- Single-model sanity: Submit LightGBM-DART small‑TTA only (test_pred_pooled_lgb_dart_tta50.npy). If LB still ~0.27, it’s an alignment/mapping bug, not modeling.\n- Pipeline parity check: Use one CV fold as “pseudo-test” and run the exact inference path (scaler per fold, clipping, TTA averaging, blending, bias, silence override). OOF on that fold must match reported OOF; if not, reconcile train vs. inference steps.\n- Consistency checks:\n  - Confirm the test_fnames used to generate probabilities exactly match the submission row order (print first/last 10 at each step).\n  - Ensure all blended models use the same small‑TTA test features file and per‑fold scalers.\n  - Disable silence override temporarily; if class proportions are absurd (e.g., silence/unknown dominate), calibration is off.\n\nPriority 1 — Submit a medal-capable blend (after pipeline is correct)\n- Use the 5-model small‑TTA ensemble you built: LGB, LGB‑DART, XGB, XGB(seed2), CatBoost. Blend via OOF‑tuned weights, apply modest per‑class bias that was tuned on OOF, and keep silence override only if it improved OOF.\n- Build submission by reindexing to sample_submission.csv:\n  - sub = sample_sub.copy(); sub['label'] = preds.loc[sample_sub.fname].label.values\n- Expectation: With the fixed pipeline, this should land ≥0.887 (bronze) and likely ≈0.89.\n\nPriority 2 — Quick, low‑effort boosts if needed\n- TTA refinements: Use only small shifts (±50/±25/0 ms). Test even smaller (±20 ms) and pick best on OOF.\n- Light tuning: Retune depth/learning_rate/reg for LGB/XGB/CB (e.g., Optuna on one fold), keep regularization slightly stronger to reduce CV/LB gap.\n- Feature minor adds: tonnetz stats; VAD-like features (percent frames above RMS threshold); ensure silence share ~10–15%.\n- Ensembling: Keep alpha blending over LR stacking (your OOF shows alpha wins).\n\nPriority 3 — Pivot only if still below bronze after fixes\n- Tiny CPU‑feasible CNN on 64‑mel log‑specs (3–4 conv blocks + GAP + dense, label smoothing, light SpecAugment/mixup), 20–25 epochs with SGKF; ensemble 2 seeds. Blend with your tree models for +0.01–0.02.\n\nEssential checklist (do before final submit)\n- sample_submission row order exact; no sorting by path.\n- Labels exactly 12 classes in the intended order.\n- No NaNs/Infs; per‑fold scaler used consistently; same TTA config across models.\n- Submit LGB‑DART only first as a sanity check; then the 5‑model small‑TTA blend."

    "llm_json": "We need to follow expert advice for our next steps. I’ll incorporate the ExtraTrees model to enhance diversity and train quickly. The plan is to generate out-of-fold predictions and test predictions using a small TTA average. Experts suggested using StandardScaler with clipping per fold; however, scaling isn’t typically needed for ExtraTrees, but it could keep things consistent. I’ll implement a new cell for training ExtraTrees, producing the necessary output files for test features. I’m considering averaging after scaling for efficiency.To ensure correctness, I should average the raw features across shifts first before applying the scaler learned from the training data to the averaged test features. That seems like a solid plan. I’ll implement the code to load the necessary data files, compute the average test features, and use StratifiedGroupKFold for 5 folds. Then, I’ll train the ExtraTreesClassifier, compute probabilities, and save the out-of-fold and test predictions. Lastly, I’ll create new cells to integrate the ExtraTrees model for blending.I have a plan to rerun a new blending cell similar to cell 17, but this time I'll include a dynamic dictionary with an optional ET path. First, I'll insert cell 18 to train the ExtraTrees model and execute it. Then, I’ll insert blending cell 19 and execute that as well. Even though the earlier submission failed, it seems the pipeline is likely correct. I’ll craft the code for cell 18 and make sure the necessary libraries are installed. Closing the opened file 'train_lgb_dart.py' is optional, but I might consider that for performance.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 18,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# ExtraTrees (fast diversity) on pooled features with SGKF; predict on mean small-TTA features\",\n      \"import os, time, numpy as np, pandas as pd\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedGroupKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\",\n      \"from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier\",\n      \"\",\n      \"CLASSES = ['yes','no','up','down','left','right','on','off','stop','go','unknown','silence']\",\n      \"num_class = len(CLASSES)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"train_feat = 'X_train_pooled.npy'\",\n      \"train_y = 'y_train_pooled.npy'\",\n      \"train_groups = 'groups_pooled.npy'\",\n      \"test_feat_tta = 'X_test_pooled_tta_small.npy'\",\n      \"test_fnames_csv = 'test_fnames_pooled_small.csv'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"assert os.path.exists(train_feat) and os.path.exists(train_y) and os.path.exists(train_groups), 'Missing train pooled features'\",\n      \"assert os.path.exists(test_feat_tta) and os.path.exists(test_fnames_csv), 'Missing test pooled small-TTA features'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"X = np.load(train_feat)\",\n      \"y = np.load(train_y)\",\n      \"groups = np.load(train_groups)\",\n      \"X_test_tta = np.load(test_feat_tta)  # [n_shifts, N, D]\",\n      \"X_test_avg = X_test_tta.mean(axis=0)  # (N, D)\",\n      \"test_fnames = pd.read_csv(test_fnames_csv, header=None)[0].values\",\n      \"n_test, D = X_test_avg.shape\",\n      \"print('Shapes:', X.shape, y.shape, groups.shape, X_test_tta.shape, '| test_avg', X_test_avg.shape)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"params = dict(\",\n      \"    n_estimators=600,\",\n      \"    max_depth=None,\",\n      \"    min_samples_leaf=2,\",\n      \"    max_features='sqrt',\",\n      \"    class_weight='balanced',\",\n      \"    n_jobs=-1,\",\n      \"    random_state=42,\",\n      \")\",\n      \"\",\n      \"cv = StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)\",\n      \"oof_et = np.zeros((len(y), num_class), dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"test_et = np.zeros((n_test, num_class), dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"start = time.time()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"for fold, (tr_idx, va_idx) in enumerate(cv.split(X, y, groups)):\",\n      \"    t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"    print(f'ET Fold {fold} | train {len(tr_idx)} val {len(va_idx)}')\",\n      \"    scaler = StandardScaler(with_mean=True, with_std=True)\",\n      \"    X_tr = scaler.fit_transform(X[tr_idx])\",\n      \"    X_va = scaler.transform(X[va_idx])\",\n      \"    X_tr = np.clip(X_tr, -5, 5)\",\n      \"    X_va = np.clip(X_va, -5, 5)\",\n      \"    clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(**params)\",\n      \"    clf.fit(X_tr, y[tr_idx])\",\n      \"    oof_et[va_idx] = clf.predict_proba(X_va)\",\n      \"    va_acc = accuracy_score(y[va_idx], oof_et[va_idx].argmax(1))\",\n      \"    print(f'ET Fold {fold} acc: {va_acc:.4f} | elapsed {time.time()-t0:.1f}s')\",\n      \"    # Test uses mean of small-TTA features transformed by this fold's scaler\",\n      \"    X_te = scaler.transform(X_test_avg)\",\n      \"    X_te = np.clip(X_te, -5, 5)\",\n      \"    test_et += clf.predict_proba(X_te) / cv.n_splits\",\n      \"\",\n      \"oof_acc_et = accuracy_score(y, oof_et.argmax(1))\",\n      \"print(f'ExtraTrees OOF accuracy: {oof_acc_et:.4f} | total {time.time()-start:.1f}s')\",\n      \"np.save('oof_pooled_et.npy', oof_et)\",\n      \"np.save('test_pred_pooled_et_tta50.npy', test_et)\",\n      \"print('Saved ExtraTrees preds to oof_pooled_et.npy and test_pred_pooled_et_tta50.npy.')\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\"\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Add fast ExtraTrees model per expert advice to increase ensemble diversity.

    "llm_json": "**Considering next steps**\n\nWe need to take action since previous submissions didn’t medaled. An expert suggested some tweaks like tiny silence boosts or adjusting global temperature on logits, but our goal is the medal. I see that there's feedback about enforcing row order with the sample submission, which we've done. There’s also a suggestion to submit a smaller model to detect bugs. It seems we’re below bronze in the leaderboard, so we might need to explore temperature scaling to improve our chances effectively.**Exploring model adjustments**\n\nThe expert mentioned that scaling logits by a temperature factor won’t change the order of the argmax, which isn’t helpful. Converting logits to actual probabilities with softmax might help, but it seems we're just complicating top-1 accuracy. When considering raising probabilities' entropy post-blend, I wonder if that could preserve the argmax. If I raise each probability and renormalize, the order stays the same, but maybe I could stack an additional model like HistGradientBoostingClassifier for better results. Training might take some time, but scikit-learn's approach could be efficient.**Analyzing performance metrics**\n\nOur out-of-fold (OOF) score is 0.731, which isn't great, and it actually decreased with the ensemble technique. The blend with ensemble tech achieved only a tiny boost of 0.89470 compared to 0.89456 without it. The leaderboard still isn't medaling, so maybe we should consider dropping LGB standard from the blend since it’s underperforming. I wonder about trying different TTA aggregations, perhaps using geometric means instead of linear averaging. I think reweighting models based on cross-validation accuracy could help, but I’m cautious about potential overfitting.**Checking submission strategy**\n\nI think we need to sanity check our pipeline alignment based on the coach's Priority 0, which suggests submitting just the LGB-DART with a small TTA. The leaderboard (LB) can't really be measured until we submit, but we can create a quick submission using our pooled test predictions. We’ve submitted multiple times already, so perhaps that’s okay. I’m also considering rank averaging across models, but maybe class-conditional adjustments, like globally boosting silence probabilities, could help. Following the expert, I’ll apply a tiny silence boost and then calculate probabilities from our log probabilities before normalizing and getting the argmax.**Implementing log-space blend**\n\nI want to set up a cell to redo the log-space blend weights we identified earlier. To do this, I need the best weights, which I can recompute quickly. After that, I should apply a silence boost—maybe going with 1.04 or even 1.05, but I'll stick with 1.04 for safety, as the expert recommended fixed weights without OOF search. I can close the training file to improve performance, but I can only execute one tool at a time. I’ll create the new cell, perform the blend, apply the boost, and then write and submit.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating model weights**\n\nI'm looking at our previous fine blend, where we zeroed out the weights for XGB and LGB in the additive probability blend. When using coordinate descent in log-space, LGB ended with a weight of about 0.159. I'm considering testing a strong three-model blend: LGB-DART, XGB2, and possibly XGB seed1. \n\nIt seems like running a selection search to maximize out-of-fold (OOF) performance could improve results. Maybe forward selection would raise OOF from 0.8947 to around 0.895? However, previous biases peaked at 0.8964. My plan is to implement this quickly and identify the best model subset for submission.**Implementing model selection**\n\nI'm considering using the geometric mean across TTA shifts for each model, instead of just averaging. Our test predictions are already averaged over TTA in the training code, and I can’t change that without recalculating. So, I'll move ahead with subset selection. \n\nI plan to create a new cell for log-space forward selection using models from the names_map, focusing on five core models (excluding ET but considering it for experimentation). I'll explore all subsets of sizes 3 to 5, totaling 16 manageable combinations.

The current log reflects a blend, which includes some noteworthy metrics. Even though the best candidate is from an older run, I think executing it again could be beneficial. However, to be safe, I should get expert advice since the directive suggests consulting at major milestones, especially considering the issues I've faced with prior submissions. I’ll ask about further tweaks and potential bugs too.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Status: CPU-only, pooled 662-dim features with SGKF(speaker).

We followed your advice: switched to small-TTA, removed per-class biases/override, used power-weights and log-space blending with coord descent. Also tried ET (OOF 0.731) and HGB (OOF 0.845) for diversity. We enforced sample_submission merge ordering. Submissions tried: 5-model small-TTA with biases (0.8964 OOF), 4-model small-TTA no-CB (0.8951 OOF), power-weighted (0.8942 OOF), log-space (0.8946 OOF), log-space + ET (0.8947 OOF), best subset 4-model (XGB, LGB-DART, XGB2, CB) 0.89545 OOF, LGB-DART only sanity. None medaled (LB consistently below bronze). Current submission.csv corresponds to log-space blend incl HGB/ET (OOF 0.89347). Artifacts available for all models (OOF/test small-TTA). We did not save per-shift test preds or model binaries; re-TTA would require retraining.\\n\\nAsk: Given the persistent CV/LB gap even after robust blending and the LGB-DART-only sanity check, what is the highest-probability next move using existing artifacts?\\n- Should we submit the best-subset 4-model log-space blend (XGB, LGB-DART, XGB2, CB; OOF 0.89545) instead of the 7-model blend? Historically safer?\\n- Any fixed, LB-safe global adjustment? (e.g., tiny unknown boost vs silence boost, class prior re-weighting by global multipliers). If yes, which factor ranges would you recommend to try without OOF search?\\n- Any additional quick validation to catch hidden alignment issues (beyond sample_submission merge) you recommend? e.g., print class distribution of final predictions vs OOF, or sanity on first/last 20 filenames mapping.\\n- Would dropping standard LGB from blends typically help here? Our subset search suggests the 4-model set without LGB/ET/HGB was best.\\n- If we invest more time, would 1\\u20132 more XGB seeds (same features) materially help LB robustness, or should we pivot to a tiny CNN on 64-mel specs given CPU-only constraints?\\n\\nGoal: Choose the next one or two submissions with the best LB-medal odds using existing predictions; avoid further long training unless necessary.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the tightest plan that maximizes LB safety using your existing artifacts.\n\nWhat to submit next (in order):\n1) Best-subset 4-model log-space blend (highest priority)\n- Models: XGB, LGB-DART, XGB2, CB.\n- Use your log-space weights from subset search (Cell 21): about [XGB≈0.2444, LGB_DART≈0.2668, XGB2≈0.2447, CB≈0.2441].\n- No per-class biases, no silence/unknown overrides, no ET/HGB/LGB (std). This is historically safer and your top OOF (0.89545).\n\n2) Same 4-model blend + tiny global silence boost (only if #1 still misses)\n- After blending, convert to probs and multiply silence by 1.03–1.05 (start 1.04), then renormalize. Avoid any class-specific or OOF-tuned tweaks beyond this.\n\nQuick validations before each submit (1–2 min; LB-safe):\n- Alignment: len(sub) equals len(sample_submission); no NaNs after merge; enforce sample_submission order merge (you already do).\n- Filename sanity: print first/last 20 fnames of your pred_df and sample_submission; they should match post-merge.\n- Class distribution: compare argmax distribution of OOF blend vs test blend; large silence deficit on test justifies the tiny boost.\n- Numeric sanity: check for NaNs/inf in test logits/probs.\n\nDirect answers to your questions:\n- Submit the 4-model subset instead of the 7-model blend? Yes. It’s your strongest and safest; ET/HGB dilute and standard LGB adds redundancy without gain.\n- LB-safe global adjustment? Only a tiny global silence boost, factor 1.03–1.05. Do not tune it on OOF; avoid unknown or broader class-prior tweaks.\n- Extra validation for alignment? Yes: the three checks above (alignment, filename spot-check, class distribution) plus a NaN check.\n- Dropping standard LGB? Yes; your subset search confirms the 4-model set without standard LGB/ET/HGB is best here.\n- More time: new XGB seeds vs tiny CNN? Don’t add seeds now (low upside). If the two submissions above don’t medal and you have a few hours, a tiny mel-spectrogram CNN is the higher-upside pivot on CPU (expect >0.91 OOF when blended).\n\nRun Submission 1 now; if needed, follow with Submission 2 (silence ×1.04). This is the highest-probability path to close the CV/LB gap with your current artifacts.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Fix the submission pipeline first, then submit the 5-model small-TTA blend.\n\n- Immediate sanity checks (highest impact)\n  - Validate submission alignment and labels:\n    - Assert exact fname order vs sample_submission and no NaNs after merge.\n    - Strip/validate labels against CLASSES = [yes,no,up,down,left,right,on,off,stop,go,unknown,silence].\n    - Inspect submission label distribution; ensure all 12 classes appear and none dominate unexpectedly.\n  - Single-model sanity submission:\n    - Submit LightGBM-DART only (you saved test_pred_pooled_lgb_dart_tta50.npy). If LB ≈ CV (~0.893), pipeline is sound; proceed. If LB ≈0.26, the bug is in mapping/alignment.\n  - Consistency checks:\n    - Ensure all blended test preds are from the same feature config (small TTA: [-50,-25,0,25,50] ms). Do not mix with large-TTA outputs.\n    - Confirm per-fold scaler fit on train-fold only; SGKF by speaker_id everywhere.\n\n- Medal path (once sanity passes)\n  - Use the small-TTA pooled features and submit the 5-model blend (XGB, LGB, LGB-DART, XGB2, CatBoost):\n    - Prefer log-space (geometric) blending with light coord-descent on OOF to set weights; no per-class biasing for submission.\n    - Backup: power-weighted linear blend of probs across the same 5 models.\n  - If CatBoost artifacts fail, fall back to best 4-model subset (XGB + LGB-DART + XGB2 + LGB), then add CB when ready.\n  - Keep TTA small; avoid aggressive shifts. Keep submission strictly aligned to sample_submission order.\n\n- Safeguards to avoid CV/LB gap\n  - Don’t mix predictions from different TTA configs in one blend.\n  - Keep class mapping exact (10 target words + unknown + silence), and silence only from _background_noise_.\n  - Run a “closed-loop LB” by holding out speaker groups and exercising the full submission-building path to catch merge/mapping drift.\n\n- If LB still < bronze after fixes\n  - Prioritize pipeline fixes over modeling tweaks; re-check fname alignment, label set/order, whitespace, and test feature pipeline parity with train.\n  - Then consider small, robust tweaks only: class-balanced weights (already used), light per-class calibration or tiny global silence boost.\n\n- Stretch (after medal secured)\n  - If GPU available, add a simple CNN (ResNet18) on log-mels and blend with boosters for silver/gold headroom.\n  - Optional: VAD-centered crop in FE for non-silence to gain a few tenths.\n\nAction summary:\n1) Submit LGB-DART-only to validate pipeline. 2) If sane, submit the 5-model small-TTA log-space blend (weights from OOF). 3) If needed, use the best 4-model subset as backup. 4) If LB is still broken, fix alignment/labels immediately per checks above before any new training."

For the medal focus, maybe I should try a 4-model blend without the silence boost since those submissions already failed. We could try geometric blending or rank averaging, but I’m unsure. A diagnostic cell to compare class distributions might help, but I’m aware submissions are costly.**Planning submission strategy**\n\nNext, I want to edit the notebook to add a cell that computes and prints distributions. I’ll also prepare for three submissions with silence boosts of 1.03, 1.05, and maybe a 1.00 baseline, but I won't submit them just yet. The assistant can only execute or edit one task at a time. I’m thinking of generating differently named CSV files to easily switch later. It might be easier to write multiple files and then copy one to submission.csv when ready. So, I'll create a cell that prints distributions and writes those two alternative CSVs.**Preparing to compute distributions**\n\nI’m planning to add cell 26 to compute the best subset logits and probabilities. I’ll also print class histograms for the out-of-fold (OOF) data and the test set, then save three variants. Once I have those, we can decide which submission to go with, probably the one with the 1.05 silence boost if the test silence is low. Since I want to keep things concise, I’ll use the edit_file tool to add cell 26 and execute it next.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 26,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Diagnostics: 4-model best subset distributions + write alt submissions with silence x1.03/x1.05\",\n      \"import os, numpy as np, pandas as pd\",\n      \"from collections import Counter\",\n      \"\",\n      \"CLASSES = ['yes','no','up','down','left','right','on','off','stop','go','unknown','silence']\",\n      \"EPS = 1e-9\",\n      \"sil_idx = CLASSES.index('silence')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Best subset fixed\",\n      \"models = ['XGB', 'LGB_DART', 'XGB2', 'CB']\",\n      \"weights = np.array([0.2444052425074738, 0.26678391198081647, 0.24474817109585956, 0.24406267441585017], dtype=np.float64)\",\n      \"weights = weights / weights.sum()\",\n      \"paths = {\",\n      \"    'XGB': ('oof_pooled.npy', 'test_pred_pooled_tta50.npy'),\",\n      \"    'LGB_DART': ('oof_pooled_lgb_dart.npy', 'test_pred_pooled_lgb_dart_tta50.npy'),\",\n      \"    'XGB2': ('oof_pooled_xgb_seed2.npy', 'test_pred_pooled_xgb_seed2_tta50.npy'),\",\n      \"    'CB': ('oof_pooled_cat.npy', 'test_pred_pooled_cat_tta50.npy'),\",\n      \"}\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Load\",\n      \"y = np.load('y_train_pooled.npy')\",\n      \"oofs = {m: np.load(paths[m][0]) for m in models}\",\n      \"tests = {m: np.load(paths[m][1]) for m in models}\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# OOF logits and preds\",\n      \"logits_oof = None\",\n      \"for wi, m in zip(weights, models):\",\n      \"    lp = np.log(np.clip(oofs[m], EPS, 1.0))\",\n      \"    logits_oof = lp * wi if logits_oof is None else logits_oof + wi * lp\",\n      \"pred_oof = logits_oof.argmax(1)\",\n      \"dist_oof = Counter([CLASSES[i] for i in pred_oof])\",\n      \"print('OOF class distribution:', dict(dist_oof))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Test logits and base probs\",\n      \"logits_te = None\",\n      \"for wi, m in zip(weights, models):\",\n      \"    lp = np.log(np.clip(tests[m], EPS, 1.0))\",\n      \"    logits_te = lp * wi if logits_te is None else logits_te + wi * lp\",\n      \"probs = np.exp(logits_te - logits_te.max(axis=1, keepdims=True))\",\n      \"probs = probs / probs.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def save_variant(probs_in, suffix):\",\n      \"    pred_idx = probs_in.argmax(1)\",\n      \"    labels = [CLASSES[i] for i in pred_idx]\",\n      \"    dist = Counter(labels)\",\n      \"    print(f'Test class distribution {suffix}:', dict(dist))\",\n      \"    test_fnames_path = 'test_fnames_pooled_small.csv' if os.path.exists('test_fnames_pooled_small.csv') else 'test_fnames_pooled.csv'\",\n      \"    test_fnames = pd.read_csv(test_fnames_path, header=None)[0].values\",\n      \"    pred_df = pd.DataFrame({'fname': test_fnames, 'label': labels})\",\n      \"    sample_sub = pd.read_csv('sample_submission.csv')\",\n      \"    sub = sample_sub[['fname']].merge(pred_df, on='fname', how='left')\",\n      \"    assert sub['label'].notna().all()\",\n      \"    out = f'submission{suffix}.csv'\",\n      \"    sub.to_csv(out, index=False)\",\n      \"    print('Saved', out, sub.shape)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Save base (no boost) as submission_base.csv\",\n      \"save_variant(probs, '_base')\",\n      \"# Silence x1.03\",\n      \"p103 = probs.copy()\",\n      \"p103[:, sil_idx] *= 1.03\",\n      \"p103 /= p103.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)\",\n      \"save_variant(p103, '_sil103')\",\n      \"# Silence x1.05\",\n      \"p105 = probs.copy()\",\n      \"p105[:, sil_idx] *= 1.05\",\n      \"p105 /= p105.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)\",\n      \"save_variant(p105, '_sil105')\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\"\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Add diagnostics for the best 4-model subset: print OOF vs test class distributions and write three candidate submissions (base, silence x1.03, x1.05).

    "llm_json": "**Considering distribution and options**\n\nNext, I need to check the distribution of my test set since I have 4,523 unknowns out of 6,473 total, which gives me around 70% unknown. The out-of-fold (OOF) unknown is 39,626 out of 64,073, roughly 61.8%. Silence in the test set seems minimal, which could be acceptable. Now, should I request expert input? Alternatively, I could switch to using the geometric mean over TTA per model, but we lack the necessary per-shift predictions. Re-running fast inference could be time-consuming, so adjusting weights for maximizing OOF accuracy might be a solution we already explored.**Exploring submission options**\n\nI’m considering ensuring I use the sample submission order, which I've done. I might try blending only XGB2, CB, and LGB_DART, leaving out XGB seed1. The subset table shows that the best four models together yield a score of 0.89545, while the three-model blend scores 0.89529, which is quite close. Should I submit the variant without XGB2? Although, we’ve previously submitted silence adjustments that didn’t work out. Testing a slight unknown boost could help, but experts warned against it. I could close open files to enhance performance, starting with train_lgb_dart.py.**Reevaluating submission strategy**\n\nThe goal is to win a medal, but so far, our submissions haven’t medaled. I think a small CNN on log-mel could be our next high-upside option, although the environment limits us to CPU training, which might be slow with 64k samples. I could add pitch and tonnetz features quickly to our pooled features and retrain the models. However, feature extraction could be heavy. It’d be wise to check if our OOF accuracy matches the reported OOF for the four-model blend, which was 0.89545.**Planning expert consultation**\n\nI think it’s a good idea to ask experts about the extreme lack of silence predictions; is that typical? They've suggested a small boost, but given the constraints, I’ll focus on requesting an expert review regarding the next step: implementing a tiny CNN. I should plan to ask for details on using 64-mel log-mels with a CPU-friendly configuration and request guidance on the exact architecture and training schedule that works with CPU only.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Status: Robust pooled 662-dim features; SGKF by speaker.

I see we have a file, X_train_logmel.npy, but I'm confused about whether it's the full dataset or a subset.\n\nIt seems like an earlier version had only 4,000 samples. So, we'll need to recompute the full log-mel features for both training and testing to prepare for the CNN. Let's ensure we're using the right data for this!**Planning for CNN training**\n\nI’m considering the computation workload for our CPU using librosa, especially with a dataset size of 64k. Each mel spectrogram takes a bit of time; earlier tests showed 26 seconds per shift. If I compute on-the-fly with PyTorch and read wavs from the disk, that might help manage the time, even if there's some overhead. Since we only have a 4,000 subset in X_train_logmel.npy, I think it’s better to extract features on-the-fly instead of precomputing. I'll also explore using torchaudio to speed things up!**Setting up CNN training**\n\nI’m planning to add a cell for training a 3-fold CNN using a data loader that computes mel spectrograms through torchaudio while caching CMVN for each fold. Given my setup with only CPU and torch installed, I’ll start coding the training scaffold using train_meta.csv and test_meta.csv to create a dataset that loads wav files and computes 64xT mel spectrograms. I prefer using torchaudio since it's already installed with torch. \n\nTo speed things up, I think I should implement per-utterance z-normalization instead of pre-passing, as experts found that acceptable. Plus, I need to organize SGKF splits grouped by speakers and save the OOF logits and test logits across folds.**Implementing batch inference and training**\n\nI’m considering batch inference on the test set and the idea of using TTA, although the suggestion was to avoid TTA and just stick to time shift augmentation during training. Following advice, I’ll implement CPU threading and use autocast with bfloat16 if it’s available, since torch.cpu supports that.\n\nI’ll create a new cell in the 00_eda_and_planning.ipynb for the CNN training script, execute it, and plan to run the training with 3 folds and 20 epochs.

Should we softmax CNN logits to probs and include as a 5th model in the same log-space coord-descent? Or weight CNN slightly lower (e.g., 0.15\\u20130.25) to avoid overfitting to CV?\\n4) Silence issue: our booster blends predict near-zero silence on test.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Short answers:\n\n1) Training: Do not interrupt. Keep 3 folds, epochs=20 with ES(patience=3). Cutting to 2 folds or hard-capping at 12 risks ensemble diversity for little time savings. Let ES do the capping.\n\n2) Aug tweaks (CPU): Keep current SpecAugment + small time shift. Don’t add background-noise mix or other I/O-heavy aug mid-run. If you later train a second seed, you can add tiny bg-noise mix (SNR ~15 dB, p≈0.3), but not now.\n\n3) Blending: Include the CNN as the 5th model in your existing log-space, coordinate-descent blender with XGB, LGB-DART, XGB2, CB.\n- Use CNN logits by converting to log-probs (log_softmax) for consistency; boosters: log of probs.\n- Start from power weights; run 2–3 coord-descent passes (step≈0.02). Don’t pre-downweight CNN; optionally cap any single model ≤0.35 as a guard. Expected CNN weight ≈0.18–0.25.\n\n4) Silence: Avoid OOF-tuned per-class biases/temps/overrides; they overfit. If you want a LB-safe nudge, apply a tiny global post-blend silence boost ×1.03–1.05 and renormalize. Otherwise leave as-is.\n\n5) CNN TTA: Skip by default on CPU (small gains, real time cost). If time remains at the very end, add 3–5 test-time shifts (±25/±50 ms), average CNN logits, and reblend.\n\nExecution plan:\n\n- Let the current CNN finish uninterrupted.\n- Load oof_cnn_logits.npy and test_cnn_logits.npy.\n  - For sanity only: softmax OOF logits to check standalone acc; for blending: use log_softmax(CNN) and log(prob) for boosters.\n- Run log-space coord-descent blend over [XGB, LGB-DART, XGB2, CB, CNN]. Save weights and final test logits.\n- Post-process:\n  - Convert blended logits to probs.\n  - Optionally apply silence ×1.04, renormalize. Produce two submissions: without boost and with ×1.04.\n- If still time and needed: train a second CNN seed (no arch changes; you may add tiny bg-noise mix then), add as a 6th model and reblend.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: follow this minimum-risk path to close the CV/LB gap and fix “silence”\n\nImmediate next steps (highest ROI)\n- Let the tiny CNN (Cell 27) finish. Do not interrupt. It produces oof_cnn_logits.npy and test_cnn_logits.npy.\n- Blend in log-space: combine CNN logits with your best 4-tree subset (XGB, LGB-DART, XGB2, CB) using coordinate descent on OOF to set weights; then apply to test. Keep ensemble to 4–5 models to avoid dilution.\n- Fix “silence”: after blending, either\n  - Two-stage gate: if top_prob < ~0.45 AND RMS < ~0.012 AND ZCR < ~0.05, force “silence”, or\n  - One-pass bias: apply small class-wise bias/boost for “silence” (x1.02–1.05) until test “silence” ≈ 9% (vs. ≈1 now).\n- Keep TTA small: only ±25–50ms shifts for pooled features and for CNN inference; average across shifts.\n\nCritical sanity checks (LB-killers)\n- Class order/names: CLASSES must match submission labels across train/OOF/test/submission.\n- Label mapping: only TARGET_WORDS are explicit; others map to “unknown”; “silence” comes from _background_noise_ crops only.\n- No leakage: fit any normalizer/CMVN on train-fold only; per-utterance z-norm for CNN is safe.\n- Submission merge: merge by fname to sample_submission order; assert no missing labels.\n- Quick LB probes: submit single models (e.g., LGB-DART only, CNN only). If all ~0.27, it’s a formatting/mapping bug, not modeling.\n\nIf blend still < bronze\n- Strengthen CNN: 5-fold instead of 3, add mixup (α≈0.3), label smoothing 0.1, dropout 0.3, AdamW + cosine LR; modest time shift (±50–80ms), SpecAugment, optional light noise mixing (SNR 5–20dB). Re-blend.\n- Add a second tiny-CNN seed or a lightweight MobileNetV2-like variant for diversity. Re-blend with the same 4-tree subset.\n- Calibrate per-class biases on OOF (greedy tuning) and apply to test before the silence gate.\n\nKeep what worked; avoid what hurt\n- Use log-space (geometric) blending with weight refinement via coord descent; initialize weights by OOF acc^4.\n- Limit TTA magnitude; large shifts (±200ms) hurt LB on 1s clips.\n- Don’t bloat the ensemble with weak models (ET/HGB reduced OOF and likely LB).\n- Target test class proportions: especially “silence” near ~9%.\n\nMinimal execution checklist\n1) Finish CNN (Cell 27).\n2) Log-space blend: [XGB, LGB-DART, XGB2, CB, CNN] with coord descent on OOF; export test logits.\n3) Apply silence correction (bias and/or two-stage energy/ZCR gate) until test silence ≈ expected.\n4) Submit. If <0.89, upgrade CNN (5-fold + mixup), re-blend, and resubmit.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-22 14:50:17] Cell 27 has been executing for 2025s and is still executing.

    "llm_json": "**Deciding next steps**\n\nI’m considering what to do next. The CNN training is running long, so maybe I should sleep again for about 30-40 minutes, since experts recommend not interrupting it. Although performance health indicates creating a fresh notebook, it isn’t urgent. I’ll log that I’ll blend after finishing up. I can prepare a new blending cell to combine CNN logits with boosters, and I can edit the file without stopping execution. This seems like a proactive move.**Implementing a new cell**\n\nI’m planning to insert a new cell at index 28, where I’ll add code to load the out-of-fold (oof) booster oofs and test predictions. This will also load oof_cnn_logits.npy and test_cnn_logits.npy, but I need to ensure those files exist first. If they don't, I’ll make the code print a message and skip or wait. Including a guard to raise an error if the files are missing seems smart. After adding the cell, I can go back to sleeping.**Crafting the blending code**\n\nI'm working on some code to load various files for my models. First, I need to load y_train_pooled.npy for the labels. Then, I'll load the out-of-fold (oof) arrays like oof_pooled.npy and others. Next, I’ll also load the test predictions. For the CNN, I’ll convert logits to log-probabilities using log_softmax. I’ll sum the weighted log-probs for combining the boosters and ensure I cap the maximum weight at 0.35. Finally, I’ll produce two submissions and save the weights to a JSON file.**Implementing code with assertions**\n\nI need to write some code that includes protective assertions and print statements to help with debugging. This will allow me to ensure everything works correctly. Now, I think I’ll go ahead and implement it by appending this to cell 28. Adding these statements seems like a good move to catch potential issues early on, while also keeping the process transparent for monitoring.
