First, I’ll create a markdown cell for the plan and then request expert feedback. Since I can only use one tool per turn, that’ll be the approach. My standard strategy will incorporate pre-extracted features, using 99 species classes and stratified k-fold with ten folds. The models I’m considering include LightGBM, XGBoost, logistic regression, SVM, kNN, and stacking with log loss as the target metric. After that, I’ll briefly conduct exploratory data analysis and start on feature engineering.**Planning the pipeline**\n\nI’m outlining the pipeline using StratifiedKFold, StandardScaler, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, LogisticRegression, SVC with Platt scaling, and XGBoost. I’ll utilize Optuna for fast tuning within a time budget, keeping a close eye on the clock. Starting with multinomial logistic regression, saga, and LGBM makes sense. I’ll then average probabilities for ensembling. I need to create notebook cells for data loading, cross-validation, model training, predictions, and writing submissions.

This dataset has 192 features along with an ID and target label. I'm leaning towards LDA with shrinkage set to 'auto' and using SVM with the probability parameter set to true, despite that being computationally expensive for around 990 samples. Additionally, I'll explore k-NN and ask about ensembling strategies.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Plan review request: Leaf Classification (tabular, 99 classes, log-loss).

Any known 2- or 3-model combo to bronze/silver reliably? 6) Any traps with label ordering for submission? 7) If adding tree model: is LightGBM helpful here or mostly neutral/harmful vs linear/gaussian models?

    "outcome": "**Overall Strategy & Model Selection**\nYour plan is strong. The winning strategy for this competition is not a secret model but the meticulous execution and ensembling of known performers. Prioritize Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and a Support Vector Classifier with an RBF kernel (RBF-SVC). A regularized Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) is a powerful third model. Logistic Regression is a solid baseline. De-prioritize LightGBM; it offers minimal value for its cost on this dataset.\n\n**Critical Implementation Guardrails**\n1.  **Leakage Prevention:** This is the most common failure point. ALL preprocessing steps (scaling, transformations) MUST be encapsulated within a `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`. Fit scalers and transformers only on the training data for each fold.\n2.  **Data Cleaning:** Remove the 'id' column before any training to prevent trivial leakage.\n3.  **Cross-Validation:** Use `StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=SEED)` for all models. Using the same folds is essential for creating comparable Out-of-Fold (OOF) predictions for ensembling.\n4.  **Submission Format:** Submission columns must be in alphabetical order of the species names. Use the `.classes_` attribute from your fitted `LabelEncoder` to generate the final DataFrame columns and verify against `sample_submission.csv`.\n\n**Preprocessing**\n*   **Primary:** Start and stick with `StandardScaler`. It is the proven, reliable choice.\n*   **Avoid:** Do not use PCA. It consistently degrades performance on this dataset.\n*   **Optional:** `PowerTransformer` may slightly improve QDA performance. Group-wise scaling (for shape, margin, texture) is a minor tweak to try only if time permits.\n\n**Model-Specific Tuning**\n*   **LDA:** Use `solver='lsqr'` with `shrinkage='auto'`. This is a powerful, zero-tuning baseline that should yield a strong score immediately.\n*   **RBF-SVC:** This is your highest-leverage tuning activity.\n    *   **Grid:** Start with a focused grid. A fast approach is to set `gamma='scale'` and tune `C` in a logarithmic range like `[1, 4, 16, 32, 64]`. A 2D search could be `C` in `[10, 100]` and `gamma` in `[0.001, 0.01, 0.1]`.\n    *   **Calibration:** For ensembling, well-calibrated probabilities are key. Use `probability=True` or, for potentially better results, wrap your tuned SVC in `CalibratedClassifierCV(method='isotonic')`.\n*   **QDA:** QDA is prone to overfitting. Stabilize it by tuning `reg_param` in a range like `[0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5]`.\n\n**Ensembling**\nA simple, unweighted average of predicted probabilities from your top models is a robust, medal-winning strategy.\n*   **Silver Tier:** `mean(LDA_probs + RBF-SVC_probs)`\n*   **Gold Potential:** `mean(LDA_probs + RBF-SVC_probs + QDA_probs)`\n\n**Action Plan**\n1.  **Immediate:** Implement data loading, remove the 'id' column, and build your `Pipeline` and `StratifiedKFold` framework.\n2.  **Baselines:** Run LDA (`shrinkage='auto'`) and Logistic Regression to get an initial strong CV score.\n3.  **Core Tuning:** Dedicate the most time to tuning RBF-SVC within its pipeline.\n4.  **Ensemble:** Generate OOF and test predictions from your top 2-3 models (LDA, SVC, QDA). Average them to get your final predictions.\n5.  **Submit:** Create the submission file, ensuring correct column order.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Execute now. Build calibrated, CV-verified probabilistic models (LDA/LR), ensemble them, and produce a correctly formatted submission. Target CV log-loss ≤ 0.015.\n\nStatus\n- Not on track: only a plan, no code, no CV, no submission.\n- Medal thresholds are very low (Bronze ≤ 0.01526; Silver ≤ 0.00791; Gold = 0.00000), implying features are highly discriminative.\n\nImmediate actions (next hour)\n- Load data; check shapes, missing values, target distribution.\n- Encode species with LabelEncoder; define features (drop id/species).\n- Set 10-fold StratifiedKFold (shuffle, seed=42); keep OOF probabilities.\n- Train two fast baselines with pipelines (no leakage):\n  - LDA: PowerTransformer(yeo-johnson, standardize=True) + LDA(solver=lsqr, shrinkage=auto)\n  - Logistic Regression: StandardScaler + multinomial LR (solver=saga, strong L2, high max_iter)\n- Evaluate CV log-loss; save OOF and test probabilities.\n- Generate submission.csv: id first, then all species columns in the encoder’s order (sorted), probabilities summing to 1 per row.\n\nModeling strategy to clear bronze\n- Probability quality: prioritize models with well-calibrated outputs (LDA, multinomial LR). If needed, calibrate on OOF (CalibratedClassifierCV with cv folds).\n- Optional third model to boost: LightGBM (multiclass) with early stopping; start conservative (num_leaves≈31, lr 0.05–0.1, reg_lambda≥1).\n- Ensembling: soft-average model probabilities; weight by inverse CV loss or equal weights; verify ensemble CV log-loss.\n- CV robustness: if data is small/high-variance, use RepeatedStratifiedKFold (e.g., 5×5). Fix seeds for reproducibility.\n\nIf CV > 0.02\n- Add QDA with reg_param 0.1–0.5 (in pipeline with PowerTransformer).\n- Try PCA(n_components=0.99) before LR/LDA to reduce noise/collinearity.\n- Light tuning: LR C sweep (0.5–3), LGBM reduce num_leaves, increase regularization.\n- Error analysis from OOF: inspect hard classes; consider class_weight for LR if imbalance exists.\n\nPitfalls to avoid\n- Data leakage: keep all transforms inside pipelines and inside CV.\n- Overfitting in boosters: use early stopping; don’t overfit to CV.\n- Time sinks: skip slow SVC unless needed.\n- Submission integrity: correct column order, no missing/negative probs.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Build pipelines: LDA(PT+shrinkage) and multinomial LR(scaled); 10-fold stratified CV with OOF probs.\n- Optional: add LightGBM; ensemble probabilities; aim CV ≤ 0.015 before submitting.\n- Ensure calibrated probabilities and correct submission format.\n- If underperforming, add QDA, PCA, light tuning, and repeated CV."

I've noticed that the LDA OOF score of 0.282 doesn't align with expectations, possibly due to the StandardScaler's effect on LDA. Although experts recommend using it, classic solutions often apply LDA without scaling. I have to think about whether features actually need scaling. Also, there’s a concern with the least populated class having only six members, which might not work with 10 splits. It seems that a 5-fold approach could ensure better representation.**Analyzing model performance**\n\nI'm looking at the published kernels, which achieve a log loss of about 0.01 with LDA shrinkage, while my LDA isn't performing well across some folds. It might be the case that StandardScaler, with its mean centering, clashes with LDA. Even though LDA can handle scaling, I need to consider that the scikit learn LDA assumes features are standardized, which is often recommended. I’ll wait for the current execution to complete before making changes and plan to integrate SVC RBF with probability=True. Also, I need to append functionality to save the submission data to a CSV file and print OOF results. After obtaining baseline CV results, I should have an expert review since preliminary results show LDA is poor.**Considering LDA enhancements**\n\nExperts have recommended that LDA is a strong option. I'm thinking about whether I should remove the StandardScaler for LDA, or perhaps try using PowerTransformer instead. It might be best to wait until the logistic regression (LR) is complete before consulting them. For now, I’ll let the current process finish. I’m considering extending the wait time to around 4 minutes to cover the remaining folds, which should take about 140 seconds.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"wait\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"wait_payload\": {\n    \"wait_duration_minutes\": 4.0\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Let the ongoing Logistic Regression CV finish to get complete OOF metrics before deciding adjustments (e.g., LDA preprocessing change, adding RBF-SVC/QDA).

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating LDA performance**\n\nI need to figure out our next step since the LDA+LR ensemble got an out-of-fold score of 0.06699, which is above the bronze threshold but still insufficient. Experts indicate LDA should be strong, yet it seems broken, possibly due to the StandardScaler. In the classic Kaggle leaf dataset, using LDA with shrinkage typically yields a logloss of around 0.01-0.02. I’m puzzled because some folds show near zero while others spike around 0.7; maybe the scaling is an issue?**Analyzing stratification and LDA**\n\nI'm considering another idea regarding our stratification warning. The least populated class has only 6 members, which is concerning for 10 splits. While StratifiedKFold is okay, some folds may lack samples from that class during training or validation. It's true that some folds will end up with 0 or 1 sample in validation, but training still retains some. The logloss spike might come from the model occasionally predicting zero probability for the true class, indicating instability from LDA and the StandardScaler's influence. I wonder if LDA's predictions being close to zero could lead to significant logloss when misclassified.**Implementing SVC and seeking guidance**\n\nI think it's time to implement SVC with probability=True, even though that may slow things down. Our dataset is relatively small at 891 samples and 193 features, so fitting it with a C grid across 10 folds is feasible. I also want to test LDA without scaling and maybe with PowerTransformer since experts recommended StandardScaler, but given our poor results, comparing a second LDA variant without scaling seems wise. I’ll modify the notebook to include new cells for SVC, QDA, and saving submission.csv. Before executing anything heavy, I should request an expert review, particularly about the LDA anomaly. So, I’ll initiate that with the CV results: LDA 0.282, LR 0.108, and ensemble 0.067, asking for suggestions on adjusting scaling or folds!**Requesting expert review**\n\nI want to ask the expert about a few things: specifically about the PowerTransformer and any potential parameter tweaks we should consider. I’ll also inquire about the choice of SVC grid and calibration methods. It seems important to get clarity on these aspects since they could impact our model's performance significantly.

    "outcome": "**Overall Assessment & Action Plan**\n\nYour primary issue is a critically flawed cross-validation strategy that is causing catastrophic instability in your LDA model. Fixing this is the key to a medal. Your Logistic Regression (0.108) is a decent baseline, but your ensemble (0.067) is held back by the broken LDA.\n\n**1. Fix Cross-Validation Immediately**\n- **Action:** Switch from 10-fold to `StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=SEED)`.\n- **Reason:** With a minimum class size of 6, 10-fold CV creates folds with zero samples for some classes, causing LDA to fail. This is the direct cause of your extreme fold loss variance (0.000002 to 0.713). This change is non-negotiable and must be done first.\n\n**2. Fix LDA Preprocessing**\n- **Action:** Your current `StandardScaler` approach is incorrect for this dataset. The most robust path forward is to test three LDA variants on the new 5-fold splits and select the one with the best OOF logloss:\n    a) **Raw Features:** `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(solver='lsqr', shrinkage='auto')` with no scaler.\n    b) **PowerTransformer:** `Pipeline([PowerTransformer(), LDA(...)])`.\n    c) **Eigen Solver:** `Pipeline([StandardScaler(), LDA(solver='eigen', shrinkage='auto')])`.\n- **Reason:** There is a strong consensus that raw or power-transformed features are superior for LDA on this dataset. Testing these variants is the most reliable way to find the optimal setup. Do not waste time tuning `tol` or `priors`.\n\n**3. Implement SVC and QDA Correctly**\n- **RBF-SVC:** Use a pipeline with `StandardScaler`. After finding the best `C` and `gamma` with a grid search, wrap the final model in `CalibratedClassifierCV(SVC(C=best_C, gamma=best_gamma), method='isotonic', cv=3)`. Do not use `SVC(probability=True)`; isotonic calibration is superior for logloss.\n- **QDA:** Proceed exactly as planned. Use a pipeline with `PowerTransformer` and tune `reg_param` over `[0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5]`.\n\n**4. Final Ensemble Strategy**\n- **Action:** Create your final submission by taking a simple average of the probabilities from your best models: the fixed LDA, the calibrated SVC, and the tuned QDA.\n- **Expected Outcome:** Fixing the CV and LDA issues should immediately bring your OOF score into a competitive range. Adding a well-tuned and calibrated SVC and QDA will push you into the medal zone (target ≤0.01526).\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Improve CV, add stronger models with proper preprocessing, and build a weighted ensemble; submit early and iterate until OOF ≤ 0.015.\n\nCurrent status\n- OOF log loss ~0.067 (LDA + LR). Above median, far from bronze (≤0.01526).\n- No submission.csv yet.\n- 10-fold CV is invalid for rare classes (min 6 samples), causing unstable OOF.\n\nFix first\n- Save submissions: sub.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False).\n- Stabilize CV: StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=SEED) or RepeatedStratifiedKFold(5×3).\n- Clip probabilities in all predictions (e.g., 1e-15 to 1-1e-15).\n\nPreprocessing\n- Use PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson', standardize=True) then PCA(n_components=0.99, random_state=SEED).\n- Keep pipelines consistent across models.\n\nModels and tuning (prioritized)\n- LightGBM (top priority):\n  - LGBMClassifier(objective='multiclass', num_class=n_classes, learning_rate=0.03–0.05, n_estimators=200–2000, num_leaves=31, subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8, random_state=SEED, class_weight='balanced').\n  - Use early stopping per fold; if overfit, add min_child_samples=5.\n- SVC (RBF) with probabilities:\n  - SVC(kernel='rbf', probability=True, class_weight='balanced', C∈{1,3,10}, gamma∈{'scale', 0.1}); use PCA to speed.\n- QDA (often strong here):\n  - QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis(reg_param∈{0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2}).\n- Logistic Regression (tighten baseline):\n  - LogisticRegression(max_iter=5000, class_weight='balanced', C∈{0.1,1,10,100} or {3,10,30}; also try penalty='l1', solver='saga').\n- Optional: kNN (distance-weighted): KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors∈{3,5,7,9}, weights='distance').\n\nEnsembling\n- Start with weighted average of top models (e.g., SVC, QDA, LR, LGBM/kNN). Weights ∝ 1/OOF_loss or tune on OOF via simple search.\n- Consider stacking (LogisticRegression on OOF probs) if single models reach <0.05 OOF.\n- Exclude weak/unstable models (drop LDA if it harms blend).\n\nImbalance and checks\n- Class weights first; optionally try SMOTE within CV if OOF improves.\n- Monitor per-class errors; adjust if rare classes dominate loss.\n\nTargets and iteration\n- Milestones: after fixing CV + preprocessing + LGBM/SVC/QDA, aim OOF ≤ 0.03; then push ≤ 0.015 for bronze.\n- Submit frequently to validate LB vs OOF; iterate on hyperparameters and ensemble weights.\n\nActionable sequence\n1) Switch to 5-fold StratifiedKFold; add submission.csv saving and prob clipping.\n2) Add PowerTransformer + PCA to pipelines.\n3) Train/tune LGBM; then SVC (small grid); then QDA; retune LR.\n4) Build weighted ensemble of best 3–4 models; submit.\n5) Refine weights/hyperparams until OOF ≤ 0.015."

    "llm_json": "**Analyzing model performance**\n\nI think our StratifiedKFold with 5 splits should be okay, but I'm wondering about LDA overfitting since the fold losses are around 0.4. We’re using a list for the labels in log_loss, which seems fine, but I worry about probabilities being zero—it could lead to infinite log loss. I’m also considering if we might need a different cross-validation seed and if there could be a data issue since the dataset should be standard. I'm puzzled why LDA isn’t performing better.**Assessing model issues**\n\nIt feels like something is fundamentally off with the features in this version; they might not be properly normalized. I’m also wondering if the log_loss computed from probabilities is incorrect because we only clip and re-normalize later. Not having clipped LDA probably isn’t helping, though a log loss of 0.3 isn't terrible. It seems many successful models use Quadratic Discriminant Analysis after normalizing by feature group before applying LDA. Considering our poor results, I should request an expert review but also check the LDA training accuracy to ensure we’re moving forward.**Requesting expert review**\n\nGiven the need to achieve better results, I think it’s essential to pause and seek an expert review. I want to diagnose the fundamental mismatches and potentially get insights into established methods. A known approach is using leaf vein features with t-SNE, but we're limited to tabular features. Experts might suggest using LDA with 'shrinkage=None' and 'solver=svd.' So, I'll move forward with a request for an expert review, explaining the unexpected poor scores and asking for a canonical baseline code snippet.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Urgent diagnostic needed: Our results are far off known benchmarks for Leaf Classification. Current 5-fold OOF: LR ~0.118, best SVC (isotonic-calibrated) ~0.194, LDA variants (raw/PT/eigen+std) ~0.312-0.974, QDA terrible (>2.8). Ensemble got worse (0.332). Historically, LDA shrinkage should achieve ~0.01-0.02. We followed guardrails: dropped id, LabelEncoded species, used StratifiedKFold(5, shuffle, seed=42), pipelines to avoid leakage. Questions: 1) What is the canonical LDA setup that consistently hits ~0.01 here? Exact solver/shrinkage and preprocessing (no scaler? which transformer?). 2) Should we use solver='svd' without shrinkage on raw features? Many public kernels used this. 3) Are we missing a crucial preprocessing step specific to this dataset (e.g., per-group standardization for shape/margin/texture, feature-wise whitening, or adding small regularization to covariances)? 4) Is our log_loss computation or label ordering off? We used LabelEncoder.classes_ for submission columns and labels=range(n_classes) for log_loss; could that mismatch be harming OOF? 5) Any known trick: add 1e-5 to variances for LDA/QDA stability, or use Ledoit-Wolf covariance? 6) Should we revert to 10-fold despite min class=6 (stratified) or use RepeatedStratifiedKFold to stabilize? 7) If tabular baselines remain weak, which other model(s) (kNN distance-weighted? NB?) are known strong here? Please provide a minimal, proven LDA/QDA/SVC recipe for this competition to reach <=0.015 OOF.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Overall Diagnosis**\nYour implementation mechanics (CV folds, log_loss calculation, label ordering) are correct. The catastrophic performance is due to a fundamental model configuration mismatch for this high-dimensional, low-sample-per-class dataset. Your LDA/QDA models are numerically unstable, producing extreme predictions. The ensemble fails because it includes these broken models.\n\n**Immediate Fixes for Medal Performance**\n\n**1. The Canonical LDA Model (Top Priority)**\nThis is the single most important fix and will produce the largest performance gain. The `svd` solver is designed for this \"features > samples\" scenario and avoids the covariance matrix instability you are seeing.\n*   **Model:** `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(solver='svd')`\n*   **Preprocessing:** Use **raw features**. Do NOT use `StandardScaler`, `PCA`, or `PowerTransformer`. This simple model on raw data is a proven high-performer.\n*   **Alternative Preprocessing:** If you experiment further, use group-wise standardization (fit a separate `StandardScaler` on shape, margin, and texture feature groups), not a global scaler.\n\n**2. Fix Supporting Models & Ensemble**\n*   **QDA:** Abandon it. The collinearity warnings and extreme log_loss confirm it cannot handle this data. At a minimum, remove it from your ensemble. If you must use it, apply heavy regularization (`reg_param` between 0.1-0.3) and a `PowerTransformer`.\n*   **SVC:** Your model is under-tuned. Keep the `CalibratedClassifierCV(method='isotonic')` wrapper but expand the grid search for the RBF kernel (e.g., `C` in `[10, 50, 100]`, `gamma` in `[0.001, 0.01, 0.1]`). Also consider testing a `SVC(kernel='linear', C=0.1)`.\n*   **Ensemble:** Only average the predictions of your strong models. A simple mean of your best LDA and best calibrated SVC is the correct starting point.\n\n**3. Other High-Potential Models**\n*   **kNN:** `KNeighborsClassifier` is a very strong baseline on this dataset. Use `StandardScaler` followed by `KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, weights='distance', metric='manhattan')`.\n\n**4. Cross-Validation Strategy**\n*   Stick with `StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)`. A 10-fold split is too risky with classes having as few as 6 samples.\n*   For more stable OOF estimates, switch to `RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=3)`.\n\n**Actionable Recipe**\n1.  Implement `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(solver='svd')` on raw features. This is your new baseline and likely a medal-contending single model.\n2.  Drop QDA from your pipeline.\n3.  Retune your calibrated SVC with a wider hyperparameter grid.\n4.  Create an ensemble by averaging the predictions of the `svd`-LDA and the tuned SVC.\n5.  If time permits, add a tuned `kNN` model to the ensemble if it improves the OOF score.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: tighten CV and ensembling, replace weak models with stronger tabular learners, add PCA+kNN, and blend only top OOF models to reach OOF ≤0.02 and public ≤0.015.\n\nStatus and key issues\n- Not on track: 0.329 >> bronze 0.01526; even worse than median 0.10834.\n- QDA (CV ≈2.83) and unstable LDA variants are wrecking the ensemble; 10-fold CV is unreliable with tiny classes.\n- Predictions show extreme clipping/peaky probs → calibration/numerical issues.\n\nImmediate changes (priority)\n1) Fix CV and data handling\n- Use StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, fixed seed); save OOF and test probs for every model.\n- Standardize consistently; prefer PowerTransformer or StandardScaler before linear/SVC/kNN; remove constant/duplicate features; optionally drop one of highly correlated pairs (r>0.995).\n\n2) Build strong base models (with modest but effective tuning)\n- LightGBM (multiclass, num_class=99): num_leaves 63–255, max_depth -1, learning_rate 0.05, n_estimators 2000 with early_stopping_rounds 100, feature_fraction 0.8, bagging_fraction 0.8, bagging_freq 1, min_data_in_leaf 10–30, lambda_l2 1–5.\n- XGBoost (multi:softprob): eta 0.03–0.1, max_depth 6–9, min_child_weight 1–5, subsample 0.8, colsample_bytree 0.8, lambda 1–5, early stopping.\n- kNN (very strong here): StandardScaler -> PCA(variance 0.98–0.995) -> KNN(weights='distance', n_neighbors in {3,5,7,9,11}, metric in {'euclidean','cosine'}).\n- Logistic Regression (multinomial): PowerTransformer/StandardScaler, solver='saga', C in logspace(-2,2), try elasticnet with l1_ratio 0.05–0.3.\n- SVC (RBF): StandardScaler, probability=True, grid C ∈ {2,4,8,16,32}, gamma ∈ {'scale', 0.03, 0.01, 0.003}.\n\n3) Drop weak models immediately\n- Remove QDA and current LDA variants from all ensembles; do not average any model with OOF worse than your best.\n\n4) Dimensionality/feature handling\n- PCA to 0.99–0.995 variance (global or per feature group if columns are grouped); consider group-wise scaling by feature block.\n- Log EDA for multicollinearity; stabilize models sensitive to collinearity.\n\n5) Ensemble correctly\n- Start with top 2–4 models by OOF (e.g., LGBM, kNN-PCA, XGB, LR-PT).\n- Prefer stacking: train a ridge/logistic blender on OOF predictions (same 5-fold) to learn weights; generate blended OOF and test probs.\n- If not stacking, do weighted average with weights ∝ 1 / OOF_loss; renormalize weights.\n\n6) Probability hygiene\n- Avoid generating ultra-peaky outputs; clip at eps=1e-5 only at save time and renormalize per row.\n- Ensure folds are reproducible; check each class appears in every fold.\n\nTargets and submit plan\n- Aim OOF log-loss ≤0.02 before submitting; public target ≤0.01526 for bronze.\n- Minimal winning recipe: \n  A) Scaler -> PCA(0.995) -> kNN(7, distance, euclidean); \n  B) LightGBM as above; \n  C) PT -> LR(saga, tuned C). \n  Stack A+B+C with ridge/logistic blender and submit.\n- If OOF >0.02: refine LGBM/XGB params, adjust PCA variance, try class weighting, or add repeated stratified CV (e.g., 5x5) for stable weights."

But then again, letting it finish might be better, even if it’s already long and has been truncated. Considering sunk cost, perhaps I should pivot.

The log_loss labels parameter might be wrong, and for multiclass log_loss in sklearn, it's okay to pass labels. If a class is never predicted, log_loss won't adjust correctly. I'm also considering the use of StandardScaler on all features—maybe scaling is actually causing issues. Although LR with a C around 3 improves, we're still not hitting the target of 0.015. Perhaps I should request expert input again, but they already provided suggestions. Using image features could be a new direction, especially with the 1000+ jpgs available.**Considering dataset features**\n\nThe original leaf dataset had both features and images, and the top solutions used images with deep learning. Although low logloss is achievable with tabular features, that doesn't seem to be happening here.

    "llm_json": "**Analyzing model performance**\n\nWe need to take action because our current OOF best ensemble score is about 0.091, which is significantly off from the bronze benchmark of 0.015. Something feels off, and it might be due to the dataset features affecting the results negatively. The classic leaf model can achieve low log loss with LDA. Our results are poor, potentially suggesting issues with label ordering. Now, I’m considering expert insights and trying an alternative approach like group-wise standardization. Also, we lost column names by loading raw arrays, but we can retrieve them and check group prefixes to improve scaling.**Exploring logistic regression options**\n\nI’m considering the One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression with tuned C values. Historically, a C of around 3 has given a score of about 0.02, and our current LR with C=2 yielded 0.093. There's a chance that increasing C to 3, 5, or even 10 could improve performance further. I need to implement focused tuning with logspace for C and possibly just use L2 regularization with 5-fold validation. We've done part of this, but interruption might have stalled progress. Given the time, it could be useful to submit the current work for a baseline score.**Considering model adjustments**\n\nI'm thinking about getting feedback on our current approach, aiming for a medal but knowing we can iterate afterward. It might be better to implement Per-Group Standardization along with LDA shrinkage lsqr again. Experts have suggested using raw SVD, but ours didn't work as expected. Our features might be very different, or perhaps we've mis-encoded the target. Alternatively, I’m considering trying Gaussian Naive Bayes, as it often performs well with many features, along with LinearSVC and RidgeClassifier with calibration. Given the time constraints, consulting an expert again could be beneficial, as they might suggest per-group scaling along with the original best practices. I’m proposing we quickly add a cell for group-wise scaling by column name prefixes like shape, margin, and texture.**Rebuilding feature names**\n\nI need to extract the feature names from the `train.csv`, where the column names are like 'margin1' and so on. We lost the DataFrame in the `load_data` function by converting to .values, so I think we should either re-read the DataFrames or modify the loading function to return DataFrames again. The quickest solution could be adding a new cell to read `train.csv` for the column names and then rebuild the arrays. I’ll implement a `ColumnTransformer` to scale the features like shape, margin, and texture separately, and plan to test Logistic Regression and SVC. I’ll also set up a new cell to build the groups and create pipelines to test LR with different regularization values and explore small gamma combinations for SVC before computing the ensemble.

While I can submit now, my goal is to medal, and I want to iterate further. I’m contemplating requesting expert review for the LDA issues, though that adds overhead. It might also be worth trying a RidgeClassifierCV or LinearSVC calibrated, or even multinomial naive Bayes.**Exploring model improvements**\n\nI’m considering that with non-negative features, the leaf features might need standardization across various ranges. Using Naive Bayes could lead to poor results. I’m thinking about trying a regularized softmax with a higher C grid like [3, 5, 10, 20, 50] and an l1_ratio of 0.05.\n\nIn our previous attempts, we might find the best C around 3-5. Achieving a score of 0.015 seems tough right now, especially since we’re aiming to win a medal. It might be beneficial to request expert review, explaining our LDA struggles and possible target leakage issues. The class order seems right, but sample submission columns might differ.**Investigating log loss issues**\n\nI'm noticing a significant discrepancy that might come from computing log_loss on integer-encoded labels. The classes labels parameter should ensure proper mapping. It seems we have 99 classes, but some classes could be absent in certain training folds.\n\nWith 5-fold validation and some classes having only 6 samples, we still ensure at least one is present in the validation fold. Since we have images available, I could build a CNN quickly, but time is tight. So, my best approach is to request an expert review to get guidance before adjusting.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"We are far from medal. Summary of results on 5-fold CV: LR(saga, scaled) best so far ~0.093 (C=2.0); calibrated RBF-SVC best ~0.163; Linear SVC ~0.164; kNN variants 0.193\\u20130.23; all LDA variants (lsqr/eigen/PT/svd) surprisingly poor: best LDA_PT ~0.312, svd(raw) ~0.519; QDA unusable (collinearity). The classic leaf benchmark should have LDA strong (~0.01\\u20130.02), but ours collapses. We ensured: pipelines, no id in features, LabelEncoder, columns aligned, labels=list(range(n_classes)) in log_loss, 5-fold StratifiedKFold. Submission columns = le.classes_. Questions: 1) Likely root cause why LDA is catastrophically bad here? Is there a known gotcha in this dataset version (e.g., need group-wise centering by block, or raw integer features requiring no scaling, or class priors)? 2) Please provide a minimal, proven LDA config that should hit <=0.02 OOF on this exact CSV (solver/shrinkage/preprocessing). 3) Are we expected to use image data to medal now, and tabular features alone cannot reach bronze? 4) If tabular can medal: exact recipe to reach bronze quickly: feature group scaling (shape/margin/texture)? Any feature selection (remove constant/dup/high-corr)? Any specific SVC grid and calibration scheme that gets <0.02? 5) Do we need RepeatedStratifiedKFold for stability? What repeats/splits? Our time is ample; please advise a concrete step-by-step to fix LDA or an alternative stack (e.g., LR-PT + RBF-SVC + kNN-PCA) with target OOF <= 0.015. We will implement your snippet verbatim next.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Overall Diagnosis**\nYour primary issue is the catastrophic failure of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model, which scores an OOF > 0.3 and invalidates any ensemble it's in. There are two conflicting diagnoses for this failure:\n1.  **Configuration Error:** You are using `StandardScaler` on features that require their raw, inherent scale for LDA to function correctly.\n2.  **Data Mismatch:** This specific, reduced-sample dataset (min 6 samples/class) makes LDA's covariance estimates unstable, rendering the model fundamentally unsuitable regardless of configuration.\n\nYour immediate priority is to determine which diagnosis is correct. Tabular features alone may not reach the bronze threshold (≤0.015) on this specific dataset; a more realistic target is an OOF score of ~0.08-0.10.\n\n**Immediate Action Plan**\n\n**1. Validate or Discard LDA (15-minute test)**\nRun LDA with the `svd` solver on raw (unscaled) features. This is the single most important diagnostic step.\n```python\nfrom sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis\n# Use raw X, y. NO StandardScaler, NO Pipeline.\nlda_model = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(solver='svd')\n# Use your existing 5-fold CV training function for a quick test.\n# lda_oof, lda_test, lda_loss, _ = train_oof(lda_model, X, y, skf5, X_test, ...)\n```\n*   **If `lda_loss` is ~0.02-0.05:** The configuration was the issue. Proceed with an ensemble including this fixed LDA, a tuned SVC, a tuned LR, and a kNN.\n*   **If `lda_loss` remains > 0.10 (Likely Outcome):** The data is the issue. Abandon LDA completely and proceed with the robust model plan below.\n\n**2. Adopt a Robust Strategy (Assuming LDA is Unfixable)**\nThis plan focuses on models proven to be stable on this dataset.\n\n*   **A. Mandatory Cross-Validation:** Switch all training to `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` to stabilize scores on the small, imbalanced classes.\n    ```python\n    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedStratifiedKFold\n    rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=5, random_state=SEED)\n    ```\n    Ensure your training loop correctly averages predictions over the repeats.\n\n*   **B. Use Group-Wise Scaling:** Apply `StandardScaler` separately to shape, margin, and texture feature groups for all models except the raw LDA test. This is superior to global scaling.\n    ```python\n    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n    ct = ColumnTransformer([\n        ('shape', StandardScaler(), shape_cols),\n        ('margin', StandardScaler(), margin_cols),\n        ('texture', StandardScaler(), texture_cols)\n    ], remainder='passthrough')\n    ```\n\n*   **C. Build a Two-Model Ensemble:**\n    1.  **Fine-Tuned Logistic Regression:** This is your most reliable model.\n        ```python\n        # In a Pipeline with the ColumnTransformer 'ct'\n        lr = LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='saga', C=2.5, max_iter=5000)\n        # Tune C in [2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0]\n        ```\n    2.  **Optimized Calibrated SVC:**\n        ```python\n        # In a Pipeline with the ColumnTransformer 'ct'\n        # Base model:\n        svc = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=150, gamma=0.0003) \n        # Tune C in [50, 100, 150, 200] and gamma in [0.0001, 0.0003, 0.0005, 0.001]\n        \n        # Critical: Test both calibration methods, as isotonic may overfit.\n        cal_iso = CalibratedClassifierCV(svc, method='isotonic', cv=3)\n        cal_sig = CalibratedClassifierCV(svc, method='sigmoid', cv=3)\n        ```\n        Use the SVC with the calibration method that yields the best OOF score.\n\n*   **D. Ensemble and Submit:**\n    *   **Simple Average:** Start by averaging the predictions of your best LR and best calibrated SVC.\n    *   **(Optional) Learned Blender:** For a potential small boost, train a final `LogisticRegression` model on the concatenated OOF predictions from your LR and SVC models. Use this blender to combine their test set predictions.\n\n**What to Stop Doing**\n*   **Stop trying to fix LDA/QDA** if the initial `svd` test fails. They are a dead end on this dataset.\n*   **Stop using 10-fold cross-validation.** With classes as small as 6, it creates unstable folds. Stick to 5-fold (repeated).\n*   **Stop using global `StandardScaler`** in favor of group-wise scaling.\n*   **Do not prioritize kNN or PCA-based models.** They are consistently outperformed by LR and SVC here and add limited diversity.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Get from 0.09456 to ≤0.01526 by adding boosted trees, tightening linear/SVM baselines, and using a learned blend with calibration. Use stable 5-fold stratified CV and remove weak/unstable models.\n\nStatus and target\n- Not on track. Current 0.09456 ≫ bronze 0.01526.\n- Aim OOF ≤0.02 to buffer LB variance on tiny test (99 rows).\n\nHigh‑impact model additions (make these the backbone)\n- LightGBM (multiclass, multi_logloss): num_leaves 31–63, learning_rate 0.03–0.07, feature_fraction 0.8, bagging_fraction 0.8, min_data_in_leaf 20–50, lambda_l2 1–5, 3000+ iters with early stopping on 5-fold CV.\n- XGBoost (multi:softprob): max_depth 5–7, eta 0.03–0.07, subsample/colsample_bytree 0.8, min_child_weight 1–5, reg_lambda 1–5, 3000+ trees with early stopping.\n- CatBoost (MultiClass): depth 6–8, learning_rate 0.03–0.06, l2_leaf_reg 3–10, iterations 3000+, early stopping.\n\nStrengthen existing baselines\n- Logistic Regression: finish tuning C in [2, 3, 5, 10]; try elasticnet with l1_ratio [0.05–0.2]. Keep StandardScaler; consider per‑block scaling (shape/margin/texture).\n- SVM (RBF): StandardScaler; C [5, 10, 20, 50], gamma [1e‑3, 3e‑4, 1e‑4]; use Platt/sigmoid calibration (avoid isotonic).\n- LDA‑kNN: LDA(svd, n_components≤n_classes−1) → kNN(weights='distance', k [3,5,7]).\n- Drop QDA; only keep LDA with shrinkage='auto' if stable; otherwise remove.\n\nFeature handling\n- Per‑block scaling for linear/SVM/kNN; no scaling for trees.\n- PCA (retain 99–99.5% var) for SVM/kNN only; avoid PCA before LDA.\n- Optional if needed: simple interaction features; consider image‑derived features later if tabular stalls >0.02.\n\nEnsembling and calibration (critical for log‑loss)\n- Collect OOF and test probabilities for each strong model.\n- Learn blend weights via a simple meta‑learner (ridge/multinomial LR with strong L2) on concatenated OOF probs; apply to test probs.\n- Apply temperature scaling using OOF to calibrate the final blended probs; use same temperature on test.\n- Always clip probs to [1e‑15, 1−1e‑15] and renormalize.\n\nCV and hygiene\n- Use StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5), fixed seed. Log mean/std per fold; remove unstable models from blend.\n- Avoid 10‑fold (too few samples/class) and LOO (variance/compute). Consider class_weight='balanced' where supported.\n- Keep feature/label order consistent; ensure submission column order matches label encoder.\n\nImmediate action checklist\n1) Train/tune LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost with early stopping; save OOF/test probs.\n2) Finish LR tuning (add elasticnet); train tuned SVM (sigmoid‑cal); train LDA‑kNN; save OOF/test probs.\n3) Blend via meta‑LR on OOF; temperature‑scale; generate calibrated test probs; submit.\n4) If OOF still >0.03, iterate boosted tree tuning (leaves/depth, regularization) and blend weights."

Our progress hasn’t been great; we have the submission.csv, but the submit_for_scoring tool failed previously. Now, it’s listed as allowed, but I’m not sure about its reliability. The final auto-grader will score the current submission, but we're not confident enough to submit just yet. Experts suggest using boosted trees. I’m considering LightGBM or XGBoost, but I need to check if LightGBM is installed in the environment. I might need to install it.**Planning a new model approach**\n\nI’m considering that based on insights from an independent coach, we might improve our scores with LightGBM, especially since our original leaf dataset performed well with LR/LDA but is struggling here. I can still submit, but hitting a medal feels impossible. My plan is to insert a cell that will try to import LightGBM. If that fails, I’ll pip install it quietly. Then, I'll set up 5-fold CV with early stopping, using suggested parameters. I'll collect OOF and test predictions to compute OOF log loss and maybe ensemble it with the results we already have.**Implementing LightGBM with LR combination**\n\nI’ve seen that our SVC score is around 0.163, and combining LightGBM with logistic regression might give a slight improvement—maybe around 0.08.

Implement a Stacking Ensemble**\n- **Strategy:** Replace equal-weight averaging with a stacking blender. This is non-negotiable for a competitive score.\n- **Base Models:** Generate OOF (Out-of-Fold) predictions for your strongest, most diverse models:\n    1. Tuned Logistic Regression (your best, C≈2.0)\n    2. Calibrated RBF-SVC (your best variant)\n    3. The new LightGBM/XGBoost model from Step 1.\n- **Meta-Model:** Train a `LogisticRegression` (e.g., `C=1.0`, `solver='lbfgs'`) as the meta-learner.\n    - **Input Features:** Concatenate the OOF predictions from your base models (shape: `n_samples` x (`n_models` * `n_classes`)).\n    - **Training:** Fit the meta-model on these concatenated OOF features and the original labels. This OOF-based process correctly prevents data leakage.\n\n**3. Apply Final Post-Processing**\n- **Probability Clipping:** On your final predictions, clip probabilities to a small range to avoid infinite log-loss, e.g., `np.clip(probs, 1e-15, 1 - 1e-15)`, and re-normalize.\n- **Epsilon Smoothing:** Mix predictions with a uniform distribution to hedge against overconfidence. `final_probs = final_probs * (1 - epsilon) + epsilon / n_classes`. Start with a small `epsilon` like `0.001`.\n\n**Summary & What to Avoid**\n- **Tree Model Ranking:** 1. LightGBM / XGBoost, 2. CatBoost.\n- **Stop Using:** Abandon LDA/QDA. They are unsuitable for this problem.\n- **De-prioritize:** Stop extensive tuning of linear models; your `LogisticRegression` is a strong enough contributor. Avoid complex feature selection like PCA or aggressive correlation removal until after implementing the core strategy.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Close ~6x log-loss gap (0.0946 → ≤0.01526) by unlocking PCA-whitened discriminants, a tuned GBM/CatBoost/XGB stack, and optimized stacking with strict CV and calibration.\n\nStatus\n- Not on track: OOF/LB ~0.09; plateau with classical ML.\n- Small data, many classes; high variance and imbalance.\n\nPriorities (in order)\n1) Make LDA/QDA work via rank reduction\n- Preprocess: PowerTransformer or QuantileTransformer(normal) → PCA(whiten=True, n_components ∈ {20,30,40,50,60,80}).\n- Train: LDA(solver='svd'); QDA with reg_param ∈ {0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5}.\n- Also try StandardScaler pipelines for LR/SVM; keep only stable variants (OOF ≤0.2).\n\n2) Train/tune strong tree boosters\n- LightGBM (finish and tune): learning_rate {0.01,0.05,0.1}, num_leaves {31,63,127}, min_data_in_leaf {10,20,30,50}, feature_fraction {0.6,0.8,1.0}, bagging_fraction {0.6–0.9}, lambda_l1/l2 {0–10}, is_unbalance=True; num_boost_round ≤1000, early_stopping_rounds 50.\n- Add CatBoost (multiclass): depth 6–8, lr 0.03–0.1, l2_leaf_reg 3–10, early stopping.\n- Add XGBoost multiclass with similar ranges.\n\n3) Build a weighted stacked ensemble (no weak models)\n- Base models (all 5-fold, fixed seed, per-fold calibration where needed):\n  - LR (multinomial, C ∈ {2,3,5,10}, L2).\n  - Linear SVC (C ∈ {0.05,0.1,0.2}) + isotonic calibration.\n  - RBF SVC (C ∈ {10,30,50,100}, gamma ∈ {0.001,0.003,0.01}) + isotonic.\n  - PCA-whitened LDA/QDA variants (from step 1).\n  - LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost.\n- Level-2 meta-learner: logistic regression (ridge or non-negative weights) on OOF probabilities to optimize log-loss; exclude any base with OOF >0.2.\n- If short on time, start with weighted blend using weights ~1/logloss, then replace with stacked LR.\n\n4) Stabilize CV and reduce variance\n- 5-fold StratifiedKFold (fixed seed); if runtime allows, bag across 5–10 different seeds and average test probs.\n- Calibrate non-probabilistic models per fold (isotonic cv=3–5).\n- Clip and renormalize probabilities before submission.\n\n5) Feature engineering and selection\n- Group-wise preprocessing: scale shape/margin/texture groups separately; try Power/Quantile transforms per group.\n- Interactions/ratios between shape/margin/texture; modest set (~10–30).\n- Feature selection: L1 logistic to select non-zero features; or univariate ANOVA/MI to top-k (k ∈ {40,60,80,100}); refit LDA/QDA/LR on reduced sets.\n- Consider PCA features for kNN/SVM; optionally feed PCA components to boosters if helpful.\n- Handle imbalance: class weights (LR/LGBM) or cautious SMOTE within CV for linear/SVM paths.\n\n6) Execution plan and targets\n- Phase 1 (fast): Finish/tune LightGBM; target OOF <0.07.\n- Phase 2: Implement PCA(whiten) → LDA/QDA grid; keep best; target OOF <0.04.\n- Phase 3: Add CatBoost/XGBoost + calibrated SVM/LR; build stacked LR; target OOF 0.02–0.03.\n- Phase 4: Bagging over seeds and minor feature tweaks; push ≤0.02. Submit frequently to check LB correlation; regularize if LB lags OOF.\n\nNotes\n- Drop clearly failing LDA/QDA runs; only include stable PCA-whitened variants.\n- Mind runtime: shrink grids, early stopping, n_jobs=-1, and incremental experiments.\n- Ensure submission formatting (id + sorted class probs).\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-09 04:57:13] Cell 7 has been executing for 504s and is still executing.

    "llm_json": "**Implementing a stacking process**\n\nI'm looking to implement a stacking process where I collect available models with OOF arrays and their losses, focusing only on those with loss less than 0.2 to eliminate weaker models. Then I'll build level-2 features by concatenating their OOF probabilities horizontally. The next step involves training a Logistic Regression model for multi-class predictions. I'll use 5-fold stacking within the same CV, applying a common approach to avoid leakage by training the meta-model on OOF data and computing OOF via cross-validation prediction.**Improving the stacking approach**\n\nI'm thinking I should use the same skf5 to build the meta OOF by fitting it on the OOF rows of train indices and then predicting on val indices. For test predictions, I also need base model test predictions for each fold. Currently, I only have averaged test predictions, and typical stacking methods use base OOF for training. During meta fold training, I can use averaged test probabilities to predict meta probabilities and average them across folds. Additionally, I'll implement clipping and epsilon smoothing together, although I worry about code size, so I’ll start with HistGB OOF and a quick blend with LR5 before stacking later.**Implementing stacking process**\n\nThe expert mentioned that stacking is critical, so I should probably add both approaches. I need to implement a cell that imports the `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and trains it with 5-fold OOF. I’ll gather base models like LR5, best_svc2 from cell4, lin_svc if it exists, and HGB. I plan to build the stacking meta with the 5-fold protocol on the OOF features. Additionally, I need to ensure that all functions and variables, like make_skf, clip_and_renorm, y, X, X_test, n_classes, classes, and test_ids, are defined. While writing the code, I'll also print logs about fold indices and times.

I'll ask for insights on whether HGB is beneficial, specific parameter suggestions, and if we should pursue PCA-whitened LDA as per coach’s advice. I'll also mention the installation issues with xgboost/lgbm and consider CatBoost via pip. It feels like a good point to reach out for expert advice!**Sending expert review request**\n\nI want to put together some concise questions for the expert review. First, I’ll confirm the stack design: using base models like LR, calibrated LinSVC, and RBF-SVC, as well as HGB, LGBM, and XGB with a meta LR that has L2 regularization. Next, I'll ask for optimal LightGBM and XGBoost parameters, including details about small leaves, early stopping rounds, and feature fraction.

LGBM cell (7) and XGBoost cell (8) both stalled during install/train and were interrupted. Added Cell 9 with sklearn HistGradientBoostingClassifier (HGB) 5-fold OOF and a stacking meta-learner (multinomial LR) over available bases (LR5, best SVC rbf, LinSVC, HGB). Cell 9 is executing but currently silent for ~seconds; earlier run was also slow/silent until interrupted. Questions: 1) Parameters: Please provide a proven param set for LightGBM and XGBoost for 891x193, 99 classes that reliably beats LR OOF 0.093 (e.g., small num_leaves/ max_depth, min_data_in_leaf for small classes, strong L2, feature/bagging fractions). Also a quick HGB param tweak if you think it can reach <0.08 OOF. 2) Installation: XGBoost and LightGBM installs were silent and slow. Should we pin specific versions (e.g., xgboost==1.7.x, lightgbm==4.x CPU) to avoid build issues? Any known flags to force CPU and fast wheels in Kaggle-like envs? 3) Stacking: We plan meta LogisticRegression on concatenated OOF probabilities (LR C\\u22482, LinSVC cal, RBF-SVC cal, HGB/LGBM/XGB). Any tips: add L2 (C<=1), non-negative weight constraints, or label smoothing on meta targets? Prefer ridge (C around 0.1\\u20131)? 4) LDA/QDA salvage: Coach suggested Power/Quantile -> PCA(whiten) -> LDA(svd) and QDA with reg_param. Given our LDA/QDA raw failures (OOF ~0.31\\u20130.52), which PCA components range should we try first (e.g., 30\\u201380) to get competitive OOF (<0.05)? 5) Protocol: To avoid leakage we train meta on OOF only; for test we average meta predictions across folds. Confirm this is correct or suggest better protocol. 6) Tricks: Any last-mile tricks that typically help here (prob clipping + tiny epsilon smoothing, seed bagging across 5\\u201310 seeds for boosters, convex weight optimization on OOF to minimize log-loss)? 7) Priority call: While Cell 9 runs, should we abandon HGB if it\\u2019s >0.12 OOF and focus effort on getting LGBM/XGB running, or implement a convex-blend optimizer on existing LR/SVC/LinSVC to squeeze gains immediately?

    "outcome": "### Overall Diagnosis\nYour pivot to tree-based models and stacking is correct; linear models have plateaued. The primary blocker is a technical environment issue causing LightGBM/XGBoost installations to stall, not a strategic error. Your stacking protocol is sound and will achieve a medal-worthy score once 2-3 strong base models are included.\n\n### Immediate Action Plan\n\n**1. Fix Environment (Critical Blocker)**\nThe installation stalls are due to attempts to build from source. Force the use of pre-compiled binary wheels. Run this in a new cell:\n```python\n# Use a command that prioritizes fast, pre-compiled wheels\n!pip install -q --no-cache-dir --prefer-binary \"lightgbm>=4.1.0\" \"xgboost==1.7.6\"\n```\nThis is the most critical step to unblock progress.\n\n**2. Abandon Low-Impact Models**\n- **LDA / QDA:** Abandon completely. All audits and your own results (OOF > 0.5) confirm they are unsuitable for this dataset. Do not waste time on salvage attempts with PCA.\n\n**3. Train High-Performance Tree Models**\nTrain on raw features; do not use `StandardScaler`. Use a high `num_boost_round` (e.g., 5000) with `early_stopping_rounds` (e.g., 100-200).\n\n- **LightGBM (Primary Target):**\n  ```python\n  params = {\n      'objective': 'multiclass', 'num_class': 99, 'metric': 'multi_logloss',\n      'learning_rate': 0.02,\n      'num_leaves': 20,\n      'min_data_in_leaf': 10,\n      'feature_fraction': 0.7,\n      'bagging_fraction': 0.8,\n      'bagging_freq': 1,\n      'lambda_l2': 3.0,\n      'seed': 42, 'verbose': -1, 'n_jobs': -1, 'device_type': 'cpu'\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **XGBoost (Secondary Target):**\n  ```python\n  params = {\n      'objective': 'multi:softprob', 'num_class': 99, 'eval_metric': 'mlogloss',\n      'eta': 0.02,\n      'max_depth': 5,\n      'min_child_weight': 5.0,\n      'subsample': 0.8,\n      'colsample_bytree': 0.7,\n      'lambda': 2.0,\n      'tree_method': 'hist', 'predictor': 'cpu_predictor',\n      'seed': 42, 'nthread': -1\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **HistGradientBoostingClassifier (HGB):** Let it run, but if OOF is worse than 0.12, abandon it. It is a fallback, not a primary model.\n\n**4. Implement Stacking and Ensembling**\nYour OOF-based stacking protocol is correct.\n\n- **Meta-Learner:** Use `LogisticRegression` with stronger L2 regularization. Start with `C=0.1` or `C=0.5`. Do not apply label smoothing to the meta-learner's target labels.\n- **Alternative Ensemble:** As a fast and robust alternative, find optimal weights for your base models' OOF predictions using `scipy.optimize.minimize` to minimize log-loss. Apply these weights to the test predictions.\n\n**5. Apply Final Polish**\nThese are essential for squeezing performance.\n\n- **Seed Bagging:** Train your best model (LGBM) with 3-5 different seeds and average the predictions. This is the most powerful final trick.\n- **Probability Clipping:** Before submission, clip predictions to prevent extreme values: `np.clip(probs, 1e-15, 1 - 1e-15)`.\n- **Weighted Averaging:** If not using a meta-learner, consider weighting models by `1 / OOF_loss` for a simple, effective blend.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Close a ~6x gap (0.0946 → ≤0.0153) by fixing discriminant analysis, completing boosted trees, and ensembling only strong models with strict CV.\n\nPriority steps\n1) Make LDA/QDA work (primary path to ≤0.02)\n- Preprocess for stability:\n  - Drop constant/near-constant features; prune one of pairs with |corr| > 0.995.\n  - Clip extreme outliers (e.g., |z| > 6).\n  - PCA with whitening to 60–80 comps (or ≤ n_classes−1); try center-only scaling (no variance scaling) or rely on PCA whitening.\n- LDA:\n  - LDA(solver=lsqr, shrinkage='auto'); also try solver=eigen with shrinkage in [0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2].\n  - If unstable, sweep shrinkage 0.01→0.5.\n- QDA:\n  - PowerTransformer (Yeo–Johnson, standardize) + PCA; reg_param in [0.90, 0.95, 0.98, 0.99, 0.995, 0.999].\n- Keep all preprocessing inside CV pipelines. Verify matrix rank vs features to catch collinearity.\n\n2) Finish boosted trees (best single-models if DA lags; aim ~0.03–0.06 OOF)\n- LightGBM: learning_rate 0.02–0.1; num_leaves 31–127; min_data_in_leaf 5–40; feature_fraction 0.7–1.0; lambda_l2 0–5; early stopping; 5-fold CV.\n- XGBoost (and optionally HistGradientBoosting/CatBoost): similar early stopping; small grids to avoid timeouts.\n- Calibrate probabilities (temperature/Platt) before blending.\n\n3) Strengthen linear/kernels (support models; won’t medal alone)\n- Logistic Regression: elastic net (C ~ 3–10; l1_ratio 0.1–0.5), class_weight='balanced', PCA before model if helpful.\n- SVC: linear (C 0.1–1.0) and RBF (gamma 1e-4–1e-3), consider PCA; calibrate via CV.\n- Group-wise scaling (shape/margin/texture) via ColumnTransformer.\n\nEnsembling and CV\n- Use only strong models (best DA, best booster, best LR/SVC). Exclude failed LDA/QDA or weak kNN runs.\n- Blend with meta-logistic on OOF probabilities or weighted average (weights ∝ 1/OOF). Clip probs to [1e-15, 1−1e-15].\n- Robustness: 5-fold StratifiedKFold; consider 2–3 repeats; keep preprocessing inside folds; bag across 3–5 seeds.\n\nFeature work and hygiene\n- Add light interactions/ratios or polynomial (degree=2, interaction_only) to aid linear models.\n- Handle collinearity via PCA and correlation pruning; check outliers.\n- Use class weights for imbalance.\n\nRuntime discipline\n- Finish interrupted cells (LGBM/XGB/X HGB, group-wise scaling, PCA runs). Trim grids, use n_jobs=-1, target <10 min per run, early stop aggressively.\n\nTargets and cadence\n- DA OOF ≤ 0.02 + calibrated booster blended via meta-logistic is your realistic bronze path.\n- If DA stalls >0.03 OOF, push boosters + stacking to <0.03 and submit; iterate after each major gain.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-09 05:13:29] Cell 9 has been executing for 193s and is still executing.

It seems like we could also use tree-based models to improve our ensemble, although installation issues are still blocking progress.**Optimizing model execution**\n\nI’m thinking it’s best to interrupt cell 10 and insert a new cell with faster sklearn models like RandomForest, ExtraTrees, and maybe GradientBoostingClassifier to generate OOFs. I’ll also simplify HGB for smaller iterations, although it stalled earlier; that might be due to OpenMP threads, but it should work now.

I really should interrupt cell 10 to execute this new cell.**Planning weight optimization**\n\nI need to insert a new cell at the end to implement weight optimization with constraints that weights are greater than or equal to zero and sum to one. I’ll use scipy.optimize.minimize, assuming SciPy is installed. If not, I'll fallback to a coarse-to-fine projected grid search over steps of 0.01.

I'll go ahead and add: \"from sklearn.svm import SVC,\" \"from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV,\" and \"from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.\" My plan is to modify Cell 4 with these imports first and consider skipping LDA later.

    "outcome": "### Overall Assessment\nYour OOF jump from 0.118 to 0.066 by increasing Logistic Regression's `C` parameter is valid, expected for this dataset, and your most critical breakthrough. You were severely underfitting. The immediate priority is to continue this trajectory. Your tree-based models are failing due to incorrect hyperparameters, not inherent weakness. Your CV setup is sound with no evidence of data leakage.\n\n### Prioritized Action Plan\n\n**1. Maximize Logistic Regression (Highest Priority)**\nThis is your clearest path to a significant score improvement.\n*   **Tune C:** Continue increasing `C`. Test a grid of `[20, 50, 100, 200, 500]`. This is the single most important action. Use `solver='saga'` or `lbfgs` and increase `max_iter` to 10000+.\n*   **Preprocessing:** Experiment with `PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson')` before `StandardScaler`. This is a high-consensus recommendation for handling skewed features.\n*   **Penalty:** Test `penalty='elasticnet'` with `solver='saga'` and a small `l1_ratio` (e.g., 0.01-0.1). This may provide a small gain over pure L2 regularization.\n\n**2. Add a High-Impact Diverse Model**\nYou need a strong second model for ensembling. There are two primary, conflicting strategies recommended:\n\n*   **Option A (High Reward/High Risk): Polynomial Interactions.** Three of four audits identify this as a potential game-changer. One audit explicitly warns against it due to dimensionality risk.\n    *   **Implementation:** Use `PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, interaction_only=True, include_bias=False)` to capture feature interactions. This creates ~18k sparse features.\n    *   **Pipeline:** `PolynomialFeatures` -> `StandardScaler` -> `LogisticRegression(solver='saga', penalty='elasticnet')`.\n\n*   **Option B (Safer Diversity): Fix Tree-Based Models.** All audits agree your GBDT parameters are wrong for this dataset. They must be made more conservative to prevent overfitting on the small sample size.\n    *   **Preprocessing:** Use raw, unscaled features.\n    *   **LGBM Parameters (Consensus):**\n        ```python\n        params = {\n            'objective': 'multiclass', 'num_class': 99, 'metric': 'multi_logloss',\n            'learning_rate': 0.01-0.03,\n            'num_leaves': 7-15,          # Drastically reduce from your previous attempts\n            'min_data_in_leaf': 20-50,   # Force generalization\n            'feature_fraction': 0.5-0.8,\n            'bagging_fraction': 0.7-0.9,\n            'lambda_l2': 1.0-10.0,       # Increase regularization\n            'num_boost_round': 5000, 'early_stopping_rounds': 200\n        }\n        ```\n\n**3. Refine Secondary Models & Ensembling**\n*   **SVMs:** Your current SVMs are weak and hurt the blend. To make them viable, you must fix the calibration.\n    *   **Method:** Use `CalibratedClassifierCV(base_estimator=SVC(probability=False), method='sigmoid', cv=5)`. Do not use `isotonic` or the internal `probability=True`.\n    *   **Hyperparameters:** Grid search `C` in `[10, 100, 300]` and `gamma` in `[1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2]`. Consider running on PCA-transformed features (e.g., 99% variance) to aid stability.\n*   **Ensembling:** Your weight optimization script is vulnerable to overfitting when one model is dominant. For a more robust blend, either cap the max weight of any single model (e.g., at 0.85-0.9) or use your OOF predictions to train a simple meta-learner, like `LogisticRegression(C=0.1)`.\n\n### De-Prioritize / Avoid\n*   **PCA for Logistic Regression:** Consensus is that this hurts performance. Only consider it for SVMs.\n*   **Weak Baselines:** Abandon kNN, Naive Bayes, LDA, and QDA. They will not improve upon your strong LR model.\n*   **Solver/Penalty Micro-optimizations:** Focus on `C` and `PowerTransformer` first. Fine-tuning solvers or `l1_ratio` offers smaller gains.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: You’re not on track (OOF ~0.089 vs bronze ≤0.01526).

For the first one, I'll use StandardScaler and try L2 with LBFGS since it's potentially faster and more stable. Given the complexity with many classes and features, LBFGS should work well, but I also want to explore using SAGA with higher Cs, setting max_iter to 15,000. \n\nI'll also test PowerTransformer plus StandardScaler with smaller Cs (10, 50, 100).

In cell 16, it looks like the lr5_* didn't print an update message at the end because we interrupted earlier. Although Out[16] shows it ended with \"Execution Interrupted,\" it printed the PT L2 best so far. Since it interrupted during ElasticNet, the final update block likely didn't execute, so lr5_* may not have updated to 0.035058.**Planning next steps**\n\nWhen I re-ran cell 11 after cell 15, it used the lr5 value of 0.036933 from high C in cell 15. After running cell 16 and interrupting, the lr5_* variables weren't updated, and now the kernel is idle. We should explicitly set lr5_* to the best PT L2 C2000 by training a single model quickly, then run blending for submission. Since there’s a noticeable improvement, we can submit to scoring, but our earlier submission.csv has 0.036933—so I’ll update it with the 0.035058 model. I'll create a new cell index 17 to retrain the best config and set lr5_*, then execute it, followed by cell 11.**Organizing training steps**\n\nI can only use one tool per turn, so it's better to insert a new cell and execute it in the next turn.

I'll need to set lr5_* to the previous best without retraining, but I don’t have access to those arrays anymore.I see that best_oof and best_test are global variables defined in cell 16, set to hold oof and test_pred. Since Python treats cell assignments as global in notebooks, they should still exist after execution. We interrupted before fully confirming, but since the output indicates completion of L2 C2000, they should be present. I’ll check their existence and, if they’re available, set lr5_oof to best_oof quickly without retraining. Then I can run cell 11 if needed, adjusting the index.

It seems that I haven't updated the lr5_* value to 0.035 due to some interruptions. Cell 11 used an lr5_loss of 0.036933 earlier and saved the submission at 06:38:17, which aligns with the last modified time for submission.csv. I'm curious why cells 17, 18, and 19 hang without printing anything—maybe the kernel got stuck previously? However, there were no prints, so perhaps there was an issue with missing imports, even though they should be fine.**Addressing execution hangs**\n\nI think to avoid more hangs, I could just set lr5_* values using the saved results from cell 16: best_oof, best_test, best_loss, and best_tag. Cell 19 hung and couldn’t execute, which is frustrating! Now that the kernel is idle, maybe the environment is jammed. I can try running a tiny cell to inspect available variables and set lr5_*, while minimizing heavy operations. I'll ensure to quickly save the submission, even though earlier attempts didn’t print. It might be because stdout is saturated, but execution should still proceed smoothly!**Optimizing cell execution**\n\nI’m considering re-running cell 11 for weight optimization.

The file explorer shows submission.csv was last modified after production started. However, the cell's status indicates it hasn't been executed yet, which is puzzling since we did start it earlier. I'm seeing the docker logs are updating. It seems like we might have to wait about six more minutes. I also need to decide which tool to use for submission later, but I won't submit until I'm sure we meet the requirements.**Evaluating model thresholds and actions**\n\nI’m considering the fact that the thresholds mentioned in the task explanation seem unrealistic, especially since the typical logloss for leaf classification competitions is under 0.01. While the production training runs, we can request an expert review. The guidelines suggest that I can use the request_expert_review tool during the background code execution. Since we’ve got a plan, the next logical step might be to implement RBF SVM in production, but I can't make changes while it's still running.**Deciding on production actions**\n\nI can edit the main notebook or others, but since the kernel is executing in production, it's best to hold off on that. Editing a different notebook is fine, but I might implement changes in the main one later.

    "llm_json": "**Planning model implementation**\n\nI see that the production notebook executed successfully, and now I need to consider next steps. An expert suggested adding diverse models like RBF SVM or Nystroem+LR and CatBoost. I need to re-open performance health because there were earlier issues. I should implement RBF SVM with StandardScaler and SVC, using a grid for C and gamma along with 5-fold OOF. Maybe I'll create a new notebook or append to the existing one to train the RBF SVM carefully.**Optimizing RBF SVM process**\n\nI realize that using SVC with 192 features and 891 samples might be slow; even with modest grids and 5 folds, it could take several minutes to fit. That's alright, though! I should add a new cell in production.ipynb with the RBF SVM training pipeline and logging for each fold, then we can run it. I also need to blend LR and SVC, but we have submission.csv ready for scoring. I’ve noticed there’s a confusion regarding the submission tools; I should only use submit_final_answer and avoid submit_for_scoring unless I feel confident.**Improving model performance**\n\nIt looks like our OOF score of 0.035 won't qualify for a medal, so further improvements are essential. Implementing Nystroem+LR could be a quick and effective option. I’ll add a new cell to production.ipynb that reuses the existing variables like X, y, and X_test from previous cells. I could define the train_oof function again or just use what we've already set up. The new cell will include the SVC and Nystroem pipelines to generate OOF and test predictions. Optimizing the blend between LR and the new model will be a key next step.**Setting up Nystroem+LR pipeline**\n\nI'm ready to implement the Nystroem+LR pipeline! The plan is to use StandardScaler followed by Nystroem with an RBF kernel. For the `gamma` values, I’ll try a smaller grid: [1e-4, 3e-4] for gamma, and [800, 1200] for n_components, alongside Logistic Regression with C values of [3, 10]. This gives us 8 reasonable configurations instead of 27. Also, for RBF SVM, I’ll keep this simple for now. I’ll then insert a new code cell in production.ipynb to run the small grid and log the results for blending.**Saving model predictions**\n\nI need to rename the OOF and test predictions for clarity, using lr_oof, lr_test, and lr_loss. I could modify the earlier cell to store these names, but since that's already run, I can quickly recompute them. Alternatively, I could run the Nystroem process and blend using LR test predictions. However, I need the OOF for blend loss. It seems more efficient to use the existing variables from the global scope, so in the new cell, I'll set lr_oof = oof, lr_test = test_pred, and lr_loss = oof_loss.

Optimize for multi-class log-loss. Deliver submission.csv.\n\nWorkflow:\n- Data loading & sanity checks: read train/test, inspect shapes, missing values, feature names, target distribution.\n- Target encoding: LabelEncode species; keep mapping to columns for submission.\n- Cross-validation: StratifiedKFold (10 folds, shuffle, fixed seed). Log fold progress and time.\n- Baseline models (fast, strong for this task):\n  1) Multinomial Logistic Regression (saga, class weights off, C tuned) with StandardScaler.\n  2) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with shrinkage='auto' after StandardScaler.\n  3) LightGBM multiclass (num_leaves, learning_rate tuned lightly).\n  4) SVC (linear or rbf) with probability=True (limited C grid due to cost).\n  5) QDA (with regularization) as a candidate if features suit it.\n- Feature processing: Try PowerTransformer(Yeo-Johnson) or StandardScaler. Consider PCA with retained variance (e.g., 0.99) as an option and evaluate via CV.\n- Ensembling: Average OOF and test probabilities from top 2-3 models based on CV log-loss. Optionally simple logistic blending on OOF if time.\n- Evaluation: Multi-class log-loss via sklearn. Track per-fold and mean. Early stop poor configs.\n- Submission: Average test probs per class; create columns matching sorted unique species labels from train; save to submission.csv.\n\nMilestones for Expert Review:\n- After initial data load + EDA summary.\n- After first baseline CV results (LR/LDA).\n- Before running heavier models (SVC/LGBM tuning).\n- Before final ensembling and submission.\n\nTime management:\n- Start with LR + LDA with scaling; expect strong baseline quickly.\n- Add LightGBM with modest tuning if needed.\n- Only then consider SVC/PCA if CV indicates gains.\n\nNext step: Implement data loading, preprocessing setup, and basic EDA logs.\n```\n[Rendered in UI]\n\nCell Index: 1 [Code]\nIn[ ]:\n```python\n# Setup: imports, data loading, CV utilities, and fast baselines (LDA, Logistic Regression)\nimport os, time, sys, gc, math, random\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\nSEED = 42\nnp.random.seed(SEED)\nrandom.seed(SEED)\n\ndef load_data():\n    train = pd.read_csv('train.csv')\n    test = pd.read_csv('test.csv')\n    print('Train shape:', train.shape, ' Test shape:', test.shape)\n    # Basic checks\n    assert 'species' in train.columns and 'id' in train.columns, 'Columns missing in train'\n    assert 'id' in test.columns, 'id missing in test'\n    # Drop id from features; keep for submission\n    train_ids = train['id'].values\n    test_ids = test['id'].values\n    X = train.drop(columns=['id', 'species'])\n    y = train['species'].values\n    X_test = test.drop(columns=['id'])\n    # Align columns just in case\n    assert list(X.columns) == list(X_test.columns), 'Train/Test feature mismatch'\n    # Encode target\n    le = LabelEncoder()\n    y_enc = le.fit_transform(y)\n    classes = le.classes_  # alphabetical order\n    print('Num classes:', len(classes))\n    # Missing values check\n    if X.isnull().any().any() or X_test.isnull().any().any():\n        print('Warning: Missing values detected; filling with 0')\n        X = X.fillna(0)\n        X_test = X_test.fillna(0)\n    return X.values, y_enc, X_test.values, classes, test_ids, le\n\ndef make_skf(n_splits=10, seed=SEED):\n    return StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=seed)\n\ndef train_oof(model, X, y, skf, X_test, n_classes, desc='model'):\n    n_samples = X.shape[0]\n    oof = np.zeros((n_samples, n_classes), dtype=np.float64)\n    test_pred = np.zeros((X_test.shape[0], n_classes), dtype=np.float64)\n    fold_losses = []\n    start_all = time.time()\n    for fold, (tr_idx, va_idx) in enumerate(skf.split(X, y), 1):\n        t0 = time.time()\n        X_tr, y_tr = X[tr_idx], y[tr_idx]\n        X_va, y_va = X[va_idx], y[va_idx]\n        clf = model  # fresh clone each fold\n        # Recreate the pipeline to avoid state carry-over\n        from sklearn.base import clone\n        clf = clone(model)\n        clf.fit(X_tr, y_tr)\n        va_proba = clf.predict_proba(X_va)\n        loss = log_loss(y_va, va_proba, labels=list(range(n_classes)))\n        oof[va_idx] = va_proba\n        fold_losses.append(loss)\n        # Test prediction\n        test_pred += clf.predict_proba(X_test) / skf.get_n_splits()\n        elapsed = time.time() - t0\n        print(f'[{desc}] Fold {fold}/{skf.get_n_splits()} logloss={loss:.6f} time={elapsed:.1f}s', flush=True)\n    total_elapsed = time.time() - start_all\n    oof_loss = log_loss(y, oof, labels=list(range(n_classes)))\n    print(f'[{desc}] OOF logloss={oof_loss:.6f} | mean_folds={np.mean(fold_losses):.6f} | time_total={total_elapsed/60:.1f}m')\n    return oof, test_pred, oof_loss, fold_losses\n\n# Load data\nX, y, X_test, classes, test_ids, le = load_data()\nn_classes = len(classes)\nskf = make_skf(n_splits=10, seed=SEED)\n\n# Baseline 1: LDA with StandardScaler and shrinkage='auto' (solver='lsqr')\nlda_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[\n    ('scaler', StandardScaler(with_mean=True, with_std=True)),\n    ('clf', LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(solver='lsqr', shrinkage='auto'))\n])\nlda_oof, lda_test, lda_oof_loss, _ = train_oof(lda_pipeline, X, y, skf, X_test, n_classes, desc='LDA')\n\n# Baseline 2: Multinomial Logistic Regression (saga) with StandardScaler\nlr_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[\n    ('scaler', StandardScaler(with_mean=True, with_std=True)),\n    ('clf', LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='saga', C=1.0, penalty='l2', max_iter=5000, n_jobs=-1, random_state=SEED))\n])\nlr_oof, lr_test, lr_oof_loss, _ = train_oof(lr_pipeline, X, y, skf, X_test, n_classes, desc='LogReg')\n\n# Simple ensemble of current baselines (equal weight).

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating model methods**\n\nI'm pondering over model methods like RBF-SVC, which can be slow. Tree-based models like CatBoost, LGBM, and XGBoost have sometimes underperformed in this competition. Historical leaderboard trends show that neural nets often dominate with image processing or engineered features. But with this dataset's precomputed features, a linear model with a power transform and heavy regularization might be best. I’m also considering PCA whitening and quantile scaling approaches, plus evaluating outlier removal and model tuning techniques like 10-fold CV and bagging.**Exploring model options**\n\nWith limited time, I'm considering asking for expert advice on a strong second model. QDA hasn't worked out, SVC seems weak, and kernel approximations aren't appealing. Perhaps I could try Naive Bayes with variance smoothing, though I’m doubtful. Another thought is using PowerTransformer followed by LinearDiscriminantAnalysis with specific parameters, but previous attempts showed poor results. \n\nUsing CatBoost with depth settings and tuned parameters may yield better performance, along with evaluating the metrics. It might also be worth asking experts about sticking with CatBoost or switching to a calibrated Linear SVM. Blending or KNN don't seem promising either.**Considering model strategies**\n\nI'm thinking of using a 10x bagging approach with logistic regression, incorporating different seeds and slight regularization to help reduce variance. Averaging the probabilities might improve logloss a bit — perhaps pushing it from .035 to .033? It seems worthwhile to consult experts about ensembling various LR models by tweaking Cs, seeds, fold splits, and even adding noise or dropping features. Stacking with a meta-learner could also be a small risk worth taking. I plan to request an expert review soon with specific questions and the notebook path included.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint before executing the long CatBoost CV cell (Cell 2). Current best OOF is 0.035058 with PT(YJ)+LR(C=2000). Nystroem+LR failed badly. Plan: find a strong, diverse second model to blend, or improve LR via bagging/regularization tweaks. Questions:\\n\\n1) Is CatBoost a good use of time here on purely numeric features for Leaf Classification? If yes, suggest a tight, fast hyperparam space (depth, learning_rate, l2_leaf_reg, iterations/early stopping, grow_policy, leaf_estimation_method) that historically works on this dataset. Should we use MultiClass vs MultiClassOneVsAll or specific eval_metric for better logloss?\\n\\n2) If CatBoost is not promising, what is the most reliable second model to blend with our strong LR? Options I\\u2019m considering:\\n   - Multiple LR bagging: different CV splits/seeds, small C variations (e.g., C in [500, 1000, 2000, 5000]), and average probs.\\n   - PT -> LR elasticnet with tiny l1_ratio (e.g., 0.01\\u20130.05) and large C, but we saw it was slow. Any known working elasticnet settings that are fast enough here?\\n   - PT -> RidgeClassifier or LinearSVC + calibrated probabilities\\u2014earlier LinearSVC performed poorly (OOF ~0.164). Any trick to make calibrated SVM competitive here?\\n   - LightGBM/XGBoost small-depth settings (e.g., depth 3\\u20135, high min_data_in_leaf) that can reach near LR performance on this dataset?\\n\\n3) Preprocessing tweaks: We got big gains from PowerTransformer. Should we try QuantileTransformer to normal or PCA whitening before LR? Any historically known combos that improve Leaf Classification logloss? Should we standardize after PT or keep PT(standardize=True) as is?\\n\\n4) CV strategy: Would 10-fold StratifiedKFold (or repeated 5x5) + averaging models materially improve leaderboard score vs current 5-fold? Any pitfalls with seed leakage or overfitting in this competition?\\n\\n5) Ensembling: If we stick to LR-only, do you recommend simple seed/param bagging, temperature scaling, or stacking (meta-logistic) on OOF to squeeze extra 0.002\\u20130.005 logloss? Any specific ensembling recipe known to medal on this competition with only tabular features?\\n\\nPlease advise a concrete next step prioritized for fastest path to a medal, including which experiments to run first and which to skip.

    "outcome": "**Overall Assessment**\nYour current OOF of 0.035 from a PowerTransformer+LogisticRegression model is a strong baseline, but your current CatBoost experiment is a high-risk, time-intensive detour. The path to a medal score (≤0.015) requires abandoning this experiment and immediately focusing on building a robust two-model ensemble. The consensus is that a well-tuned LightGBM blended with a strengthened LR model is the fastest and most reliable strategy.\n\n**Critical Path to Medal (Execute in Order)**\n\n1.  **STOP THE CATBOOST EXPERIMENT IMMEDIATELY.**\n    It is a poor use of your remaining time.\n\n2.  **BUILD A CONSERVATIVE LIGHTGBM MODEL (1 Hour)**\n    This is your best candidate for a diverse second model.\n    *   **Use RAW features.** Do not apply PowerTransformer or any scaling.\n    *   **Use these conservative parameters** to prevent overfitting on the small dataset:\n        ```python\n        lgbm_params = {\n            'objective': 'multiclass', 'num_class': 99, 'metric': 'multi_logloss',\n            'learning_rate': 0.01,\n            'n_estimators': 5000,\n            'num_leaves': 10,          # Critical: low value\n            'max_depth': 5,            # Critical: low value\n            'min_child_samples': 20,   # Critical: prevents fitting noise\n            'feature_fraction': 0.7,\n            'subsample': 0.8,\n            'lambda_l2': 5.0,\n            'seed': 42, 'n_jobs': -1, 'verbose': -1\n        }\n        # Use early stopping with a patience of 150-200 rounds.\n        # Abort if OOF score is not trending below 0.05.\n        ```\n\n3.  **STRENGTHEN LOGISTIC REGRESSION VIA SEED BAGGING (1-2 Hours)**\n    This is a high-ROI action to improve your best model's stability and score.\n    *   Train 5-10 `LogisticRegression` models using your best preprocessing pipeline (`PowerTransformer(YJ)`).\n    *   Vary the `random_state` for each model's `StratifiedKFold` split (e.g., seeds `[42, 123, 456, 789, 101]`).\n    *   Vary `C` slightly across runs (e.g., `[1000, 2000, 4000]`).\n    *   Average the resulting OOF and test predictions to create a single, robust LR submission. This alone should improve your score.\n\n4.  **ENSEMBLE WITH STACKING (30 Mins)**\n    This is the proven method for the final score push.\n    *   **Features:** Concatenate the OOF predictions from your bagged LR model and your LGBM model (`np.hstack([bagged_lr_oof, lgbm_oof])`).\n    *   **Meta-Model:** Train a simple `LogisticRegression(C=0.1, penalty='l2')` on these new features and the original target labels.\n    *   **Prediction:** Use the trained meta-model to predict on the similarly stacked test set predictions.\n\n5.  **FINAL POLISH (IF TIME PERMITS)**\n    *   **Temperature Scaling:** On your final stacked predictions, perform temperature scaling to calibrate probabilities. Find the optimal temperature `T` on your OOF predictions before applying it to the test set.\n    *   **10-Fold CV:** For your final run generating the bagged LR and LGBM predictions, switch from 5-fold to 10-fold CV for more stable scores.\n\n**De-prioritize / Avoid:**\n*   **Wide GBDT Grids:** Do not run broad hyperparameter searches for CatBoost or LightGBM.\n*   **Complex Preprocessing:** Do not experiment with PCA, whitening, or complex feature combinations. Stick to `PowerTransformer` for LR and raw features for LGBM.\n*   **Alternative Models:** Do not spend time on SVM, ElasticNet, or Nystroem methods.\n*   **CatBoost:** It is slower and historically less effective than LightGBM on this dataset. Avoid it.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: cut LB log-loss from 0.0479 toward ≤0.01526 by closing the CV–LB gap, making LR stronger, adding a second comparably strong model, and blending only strong, diverse models.\n\nConcise, actionable plan\n- Fix validation/generalization\n  - Use robust CV: RepeatedStratifiedKFold (e.g., 5x3) and/or 10-fold; keep identical folds across models for fair blending.\n  - Calibrate probabilities in-fold: CalibratedClassifierCV (isotonic, cv=3).\n  - Average probs across repeats/seeds; clip and renormalize identically for OOF and test.\n  - Track per-fold losses/variance; re-seed if a fold is consistently off; verify no leakage.\n\n- Strengthen the Logistic Regression line (your current best)\n  - Hyperparams: sweep C ∈ [500, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000]; max_iter up to 5000–50000; tol=1e-5.\n  - Solvers: lbfgs (multinomial, L2), try penalty='none'; also test saga elastic-net with very low L1 ratios (l1_ratio ∈ [0.05, 0.2, 0.5]).\n  - Feature engineering: degree-2 interaction-only PolynomialFeatures; targeted interactions between shape/margin/texture groups; ratios and differences; add PCA components (retain 95–99% variance) as extra features.\n  - Preprocessing variants for diversity: PowerTransformer (YJ), QuantileTransformer(to normal), RobustScaler; optionally PT(no standardize) → StandardScaler.\n  - Mild feature selection for noise: VarianceThreshold; SelectKBest(mutual_info, k ∈ [60, 90, 120]); or SelectFromModel(RidgeCV).\n\n- Build a second strong model (aim OOF ≈ LR, not weaker)\n  - CatBoost: depth [6, 8], lr [0.03, 0.06, 0.1], l2_leaf_reg [3, 10, 30], random_strength [0.5, 1.5], bagging_temperature [0.25, 1.0], iterations up to 10000 with early_stopping_rounds=300; multiple seeds and CV repeats.\n  - LightGBM: objective=multiclass, num_leaves [15, 31, 63], max_depth [-1, 8, 12], lr [0.03, 0.06], min_data_in_leaf [10, 20, 50], feature_fraction [0.7, 0.9], bagging_fraction [0.7, 0.9], lambda_l2 [0, 5, 15], num_boost_round up to 10000 with early stopping; multiple seeds.\n  - If needed for diversity: XGBoost (gpu_hist if available), ExtraTrees/RandomForest (large n_estimators), MLP with strong regularization, Kernel Ridge (prob-calibrated).\n\n- Ensemble only when bases are strong\n  - Optimize blend weights on OOF (nonnegative, sum=1) to minimize log-loss; or stack with a meta-learner (logistic regression) on OOF predictions using inner CV to avoid leakage.\n  - Bagging across seeds/folds/preprocessors within each model family; then blend families.\n  - Monitor inter-model correlation; prioritize low-correlation pairs.\n\n- Overfitting control and data handling\n  - Address OOF–LB gap via calibration, repeated CV, and slightly stronger regularization in blends.\n  - Consider dropping low-variance/redundant features; try PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n  - Optional small-data tactics: light noise injection or SMOTE (if class imbalance appears).\n  - Ensure submission formatting, class order, and probability clipping are consistent.\n\n- Workflow speed/quality\n  - Parallelize CV/grid; use GPU for boosting if available.\n  - Log configs, seeds, and per-fold metrics; reuse folds across models.\n\nImmediate next steps (fastest impact)\n1) Finish CatBoost with the expanded grid + early stopping across multiple seeds; get OOF.\n2) Train LR variants: lbfgs (L2), penalty='none', and saga elastic-net with interaction-only degree-2 features; try QuantileTransformer and RobustScaler versions. Calibrate each via in-fold isotonic.\n3) Keep best 3–5 diverse models with OOF near the LR; optimize blend weights on OOF or stack; submit the calibrated blend.\n4) If boosting models are still weak, pivot to tuned LightGBM/XGBoost; repeat steps 2–3."

The workflow suggests using request_expert_review at major checkpoints. This could help refine configurations and troubleshoot the heavy runtimes I encountered, especially with CatBoost. I’m also considering switching to a faster solver like lbfgs instead of saga for improved accuracy. To keep everything running smoothly, I should also close some files. Let’s request expert advice to guide us through.**Evaluating progress and seeking advice**\n\nI need to provide a clear path and ask specific questions. Our goal is to reach a performance metric of ≤0.015, but we're currently at 0.035. The expert plan suggested using LGBM conservatively and implementing LR bagging. We interrupted the LGBM process, possibly due to installation delays, but it is installed now. Our bagging cell hasn't produced output likely because the first fold is still running. I should request advice on improving speed and whether to use a 10-fold vs. 5-fold approach, plus details on stacking and calibration.**Requesting expert review**\n\nI think it’s the right time to request an expert review. I’ll include a summary of our current progress and specifically ask for the exact LGBM parameters and the stacking procedure. It’s also important to inquire whether using lbfgs with a penalty set to 'none' would be beneficial for our setup. These insights should help refine our processes, so let’s go ahead and make that request!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint: pivoting to medal path.

Need expert guidance to minimize time-to-medal.\\n\\nAsk 1) LightGBM exact recipe: Please provide a proven fast config for Leaf Classification tabular features that can reach ~0.03 OOF or better, including: objective=multiclass, num_class=99; recommended num_leaves, max_depth, min_data_in_leaf, feature_fraction, bagging_fraction, lambda_l2, learning_rate; num_boost_round and early_stopping settings; whether to use categorical handling (none here), monotone constraints (none), or dart/goss; and whether to use raw features vs any minimal preprocessing. Also confirm using scikit\\u2019s LGBMClassifier vs lgb.cv for reproducibility.\\n\\nAsk 2) LR bagging specifics: Best practice for diversity with minimal runtime\\u2014how many seeds and Cs? e.g., seeds=[42,123,456,789,101], Cs=[1000,2000,4000]?

If stacking, exact meta-setup: inner CV or single fit on OOF, C for meta-LR (e.g., 0.1), and any calibration/temperature scaling best practice on stacked preds.\\n\\nAsk 4) CV strategy under time limits: Stick with 5-fold for both families to move fast, or switch to 10-fold only on final fit? Any known fold seeds that work well for this dataset to reduce variance?

    "outcome": "**Overall Strategy:**\n- Stop all experimentation. Abandon CatBoost and Nystroem methods permanently.\n- The path to a medal is a two-model ensemble: a bagged Logistic Regression (LR) and a single LightGBM (LGBM).\n- Focus exclusively on executing the following plan.\n\n**Model 1: LightGBM (LGBM)**\n- **Features:** Use raw, untransformed features only. This provides diversity against the transformed features used in the LR model.\n- **CV:** Use 5-fold `StratifiedKFold`.\n- **Parameters:** Use `LGBMClassifier` with the following conservative configuration. Set `n_estimators` high and use early stopping.\n  - `objective`: 'multiclass', `num_class`: 99\n  - `learning_rate`: 0.02\n  - `n_estimators`: 5000+ (with `early_stopping_rounds=200`)\n  - `num_leaves`: 12\n  - `max_depth`: 5-6\n  - `min_child_samples` / `min_data_in_leaf`: 25-30\n  - `feature_fraction`: 0.7\n  - `bagging_fraction` / `subsample`: 0.8\n  - `lambda_l2`: 5.0\n  - `random_state`: 42, `n_jobs`: -1\n\n**Model 2: Bagged Logistic Regression (LR)**\n- **Preprocessing:** Continue using `PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson', standardize=True)`.\n- **Solver:** Switch from `saga` to `lbfgs` for better speed and stability with L2 penalty.\n- **Bagging:** Create an ensemble of 5-10 LR models by varying both the CV `random_state` (seed) and the `C` parameter.\n  - **Seeds:** Use at least 5 distinct seeds (e.g., 42, 123, 456, 789, 101).\n  - **C values:** Vary `C` around your best value (e.g., 1500, 2000, 3000).\n- **Output:** Average the probabilities from all bagged models to create a single set of OOF and test predictions.\n\n**Ensembling**\n- **Input:** Use the Out-of-Fold (OOF) predictions from the bagged LR and the single LGBM.\n- **Method:** Two valid approaches exist. A weighted blend is faster and safer; stacking is potentially more powerful.\n  - **Option A (Recommended): Weighted Blend.** Optimize a single weight `w` in the range [0, 1] to minimize the log-loss of `w * lr_bag_oof + (1 - w) * lgbm_oof`. Apply the same `w` to the test predictions.\n  - **Option B: Stacking.** Use a `LogisticRegression(C=0.1)` meta-model trained on the horizontally stacked OOF predictions (`[lr_bag_oof, lgbm_oof]`).\n\n**Final Steps**\n- **Calibration:** Apply Temperature Scaling to the final ensembled predictions. Optimize a single temperature scalar `T` on the OOF predictions to minimize log-loss. Apply this `T` to the final test predictions.\n- **CV Strategy:** Use 5-fold `StratifiedKFold` throughout. Only consider a 10-fold refit of the final models if you have significant time remaining.\n\n**Execution Plan:**\n1.  **Run LGBM:** Train the single LGBM model on raw features using the specified parameters. Save OOF and test predictions.\n2.  **Run LR Bagging:** Execute the 5-10 LR models with the `lbfgs` solver. Average the results to get final OOF and test predictions.\n3.  **Ensemble:** Combine the predictions from Step 1 and 2 using either a weighted blend or stacking.\n4.  **Calibrate & Submit:** Apply Temperature Scaling to the ensembled test predictions and generate your submission file.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: prioritize stronger linear ensembles, stabilize CV, and add lightweight diversity; only explore boosters if time/resources allow and after linear variants plateau.\n\nStatus and gap\n- Not on track yet: best OOF 0.0351, LB 0.0479 vs bronze ≤0.01526 (≈3× reduction needed). OOF < LB indicates CV–test mismatch/overfit.\n\nImmediate actions (fastest impact)\n- Core LR pipeline\n  - Use PowerTransformer(Yeo–Johnson) with lbfgs, multinomial, L2; raise max_iter.\n  - Sweep C on a tight log grid around current best: [800, 1200, 1800, 2400, 3000, 5000, 10000].\n  - Run 10-fold StratifiedKFold (or 5×2 repeated) for stability.\n  - Seed-bagging: 3–5 different CV seeds × 3–4 C values; average probabilities.\n- Lightweight preprocessing variants to blend\n  - PT(YJ, standardize=True) (current), PT(YJ) + separate StandardScaler, QuantileTransformer(output_distribution='normal', n_quantiles=min(1000, n_samples)).\n  - Optional: PT(YJ) + PCA retaining 95–99% variance; blend if competitive.\n- Feature-group diversity\n  - Train PT+LR on each group: shape_*, margin_*, texture_*; blend these with the full-feature model using inverse-loss or OOF-based weights.\n- CV/LB hygiene\n  - Keep all transforms inside Pipeline; ensure label order consistency, stable seeds.\n  - Clip and renormalize probs before log-loss; consider light temperature scaling after models are fixed.\n\nIf/when linear plateaus, add controlled diversity\n- Bagging LR across seeds/C as a dedicated ensemble; expect small OOF drops (≈0.005–0.01).\n- Optional elastic-net: saga with very light l1_ratio ∈ [0.01, 0.05] only if as fast/stable as lbfgs.\n- Stacking: use OOF predictions of 2–4 strong base models (LR variants + feature-group models) as inputs to a simple level-2 LR.\n\nBoosted trees and others (use sparingly)\n- Only after above and if resources are stable:\n  - CatBoost/LGBM/XGBoost with small, early-stopped configs (2–3k iters max, early_stopping_rounds≈100, conservative depth/leaves). Run minimal grids, monitor folds, save partial OOFs.\n  - Stop early if fold losses ≫ LR (e.g., >0.1); otherwise blend if OOF ≈0.03–0.04.\n- Deprioritize SVC/Nystroem unless you find a clearly strong setup.\n\nStability and iteration speed\n- Address prior interruptions: split runs, reduce grids, save per-fold outputs, increase resources if possible.\n- Use 3-fold quick scans to prune configs, then finalize with 10-fold.\n- Submit frequently to check CV–LB alignment; adjust CV (more folds/repeats) if gap persists.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Run 10-fold PT(YJ)+LR (lbfgs) with C in [800–10000]; pick best 2–3 and average.\n- Add 2–3 new CV seeds and average (seed-bag).\n- Train three PT+LRs on shape/margin/texture; blend with full-feature LR via OOF-weighted averaging.\n- Add QuantileTransformer and PT+PCA LR variants; blend if OOF improves.\n- If still >0.02 OOF, try a minimal, early-stopped CatBoost/LGBM; blend only if OOF ≈0.03–0.04.\n- Keep all preprocessing in-pipeline, clip/renorm probs, and monitor CV–LB gap."

First, I’ll create a markdown cell for the plan and then request expert feedback\n💭 . Since I can only use one tool per turn, that’ll be the approach. My standard strategy will incorporate pre-extracted features, using 99 species classes and stratified k-fold with ten folds. The models\n💭 I’m considering include LightGBM, XGBoost, logistic regression, SVM, kNN, and stacking with log loss as the target metric. After that, I’ll briefly conduct exploratory data analysis and start on feature\n💭 engineering.\n💭 **Planning the pipeline** I’m outlining the pipeline using StratifiedKFold, StandardScaler, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, LogisticRegression, SVC with Platt scaling, and XGBoost. I’ll utilize Optuna for\n💭 fast tuning within a time budget, keeping a close eye on the clock. Starting with multinomial logistic regression, saga, and LGBM makes sense. I’ll then average probabilities for ensembling. I need to\n💭 create notebook cells for data loading, cross-validation, model training, predictions, and writing submissions. Adding an initial code skeleton with imports, logging utilities, data loading, target label\n💭 encoding, and basic checks will be my next step, along with a markdown plan.\n🧠 Agent responded: edit_notebook\n🔧 🤖 Processing insert_cell: \n2025-09-09 03:42:54,094 - isolated_notebook - INFO - Reusing existing IsolatedNotebook instance for 'main'.\nINFO: Notebook 'main': Adding markdown cell at index 0.\nINFO: Notebook 'main': Added cell 518245a9-d7e4-402d-8179-0eddccbae57a at index 0.\nINFO: Notebook 'main': [2025-09-09 03:42:54] Cell added at index 0 (type: markdown) in `main.ipynb`.\nINFO: 📤 Publishing cell_added event for cell 0 (type: markdown)\nINFO: ✅ cell_added event published successfully for cell 0 (shifted: False)\nCell added at index 0\n2025-09-09 03:42:54,094 - isolated_notebook - INFO - Reusing existing IsolatedNotebook instance for 'main'.\nINFO: Resolving notebook: /app/agent_run_states/leaf-classification-spray-20250909-033436/main.ipynb\nINFO: Notebook 'main': Saving 1 cells to .ipynb...\nINFO: Notebook 'main' saved to /app/agent_run_states/leaf-classification-spray-20250909-033436/main.ipynb.\nINFO: Notebook 'main': Saved after successful operation.\nINFO: Formatted notebook 'main' successfully (1 cells).

Since I've defined clip_and_renorm in prior cells, it's\n💭 already set. Now, for modifying both existing cells 3 and 4, I need to edit the notebook twice, as the tool only allows one cell modification per call. I’ll start with cell 3 for the LGBM changes, updating\n💭 the parameters and improving the logs. I also need to ensure I use 'bagging_fraction' instead of 'subsample.'\n💭 **Adjusting model parameters** I think I’ll keep 'subsample' at 0.8 for now. I want to change other parameters: setting learning_rate to 0.02, num_leaves to 12, max_depth to 6, min_child_samples to 28\n💭 , and early_rounds to 200. The metrics will stay the same. Now, about the early abort check, should I remove it or keep it at >0.06? They mentioned aborting if OOF isn’t trending below 0.05, so I'll set\n💭 the mean check to >0.06 after two folds.

I could switch the LR bagging cell to lbfgs\n💭 and expand the configs, but I believe I can’t edit while another cell runs. Although I read I can edit the notebook while code runs, it’s probably safer to finish the LGBM first and then modify cell 4\n💭 . I’ll plan to wait another 10 minutes.\n💭 **Timing for LGBM completion** I think it’s best to wait about 12 minutes to let the LGBM finish the 5 folds with early stopping. This should give it enough time to complete its process thoroughly without\n💭 interruptions, which means I can avoid potentially disrupting anything important. Providing this explanation helps clarify the reason for the wait. So, I’ll set the timer for 12 minutes now.

But let's go ahead and execute cell 6!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"execute_notebook_code\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"code_execution_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"execute_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 6\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Run ensemble + temperature scaling (cell 6). It has a fallback to use single PT+LR outputs from cell 0. This will regenerate submission.csv. If execution hangs, interrupt and proceed with the existing submission.csv.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "Cell 0 is currently executing (for 646s). Interrupt execution before executing another cell."
  },
