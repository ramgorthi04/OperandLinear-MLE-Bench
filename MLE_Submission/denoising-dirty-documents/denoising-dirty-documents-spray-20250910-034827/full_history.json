First, I’ll create a notebook with a markdown cell for the plan, and then insert some setup code. Since I can only use one tool at a time, I’ll focus on inserting that plan cell and also check for packages.\n\nFor the analysis, I’ll consider traditional methods like OpenCV adaptive thresholding and more advanced techniques such as BM3D and U-Net for efficient outcomes. I'll aim to balance between a classic pipeline and meeting leaderboard targets for RMSE.**Setting up the initial pipeline**\n\nFirst, I need to insert some code for importing libraries, defining paths, listing images, and calculating RMSE. I’ll visualize a few images, but I’ll keep this part concise. \n\nNext, I'll create an initial pipeline function that converts images to grayscale, applies median blur, and possibly adaptive thresholding. However, I need to remember that the expected output is in continuous grayscale for the competition.\n\nI'll implement baseline methods like fastNlMeansDenoising and Gaussian blur, then perform a grid search with K-Fold validation to optimize parameters across a small dataset of about 144 images. For final evaluation, I’ll choose the best pipeline variant based on average RMSE from cross-validation.**Creating the initial notebook**\n\nI’m going to set up an initial notebook that includes a plan and some code scaffolding, plus a function to compute pipeline outputs and RMSE. First, I’ll insert several cells, starting with a markdown plan followed by imports and path setups.\n\nNext, I need utility functions for loading and saving images, and I’ll create an RMSE function. I’ll define multiple pipeline functions and store them in a dictionary. After that, I’ll run an evaluation loop over the training images to compute the average RMSE for each pipeline. \n\nFinally, I'll generate predictions on the test set using the best pipeline and ensure our submission format for the Denoising Dirty Documents competition matches the required structure by checking the sampleSubmission.csv. I’ll write code to read the header and confirm the expected ordering and pixel count.**Reading submission format**\n\nI need to confirm the expected format for the submission, which seems to require one column structured as \"id,value,\" where the id looks something like \"1_1\" or \"1_2.\" So, I’ll write code to read the sampleSubmission.csv and print the first few rows to verify the format.

It's important to use the request_expert_review after composing our plan since it acts as a major checkpoint. The workflow indicates we should leverage the expert tool at these points. Now that we have the plan cell created, I should go ahead and request the expert review, providing the path to main.ipynb and asking for guidance on classical pipelines and submission efficiency.

Advise on first pipeline(s) to implement and evaluation strategy (full-train average RMSE vs holdout).\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Overall Verdict & Immediate Action**\nYour plan is solid but over-theorized. With 24 hours left, you must stop planning and start coding immediately. The consensus is to aim for a Bronze medal (<0.045 RMSE) within 2-4 hours using a simple baseline, then iterate towards Silver (<0.026 RMSE).\n\n**Action Plan: First 4 Hours to Secure Bronze**\n1.  **Code Skeleton (1 Hour):** Implement basic I/O functions (`cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)`), the RMSE metric, and a submission file generator. Verify your submission format against `sampleSubmission.csv` immediately.\n2.  **Baseline Pipeline (2-3 Hours):** Implement a single Non-Local Means (NLM) pipeline: `cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising()`. This is consistently cited as the most effective single filter for this problem.\n3.  **Global Tuning & Submission:** Find the single best `h` parameter (filter strength) by testing values in the range `[8, 20]` on the entire training set and calculating the average RMSE. Use the default `templateWindowSize=7` and `searchWindowSize=21`. Submit the result from the best global `h`. This is your safety net and likely a Bronze medal.\n\n**Pipelines & Strategy for Silver**\nThe winning pattern is a multi-stage pipeline. Start with global parameters, then consider a lightweight per-image approach if time permits.\n\n*   **Core Pipeline Structure:**\n    1.  **Background Normalization:** Correct uneven illumination and large stains.\n    2.  **Denoising:** Remove noise while preserving text.\n    3.  **Post-processing (Optional):** Sharpen text.\n\n*   **Recommended Pipelines to Test:**\n    *   **A) Robust NLM (Highest Priority):** Morphological Opening (large 31x31 or 41x41 ellipse kernel) -> Median Blur (3x3) -> NLM (`h=10`).\n    *   **B) Alternative Denoise:** Morphological Opening -> Guided Filter (`radius=8, eps=1e-3`) or Bilateral Filter (`d=9, sigmaColor=25-75, sigmaSpace=75`). The Guided Filter is often faster and very competitive.\n    *   **C) Contrast-Focused:** CLAHE -> NLM -> Unsharp Masking. **Use with caution**, as CLAHE and unsharp masking can amplify background noise and hurt RMSE if not tuned carefully.\n\n*   **Tuning Strategy:**\n    1.  **Global First:** Find the best single set of parameters for one pipeline by optimizing the average RMSE across all training images.\n    2.  **Lightweight Per-Image (If Time):** Do not run a full grid search per image. Instead, create 3-5 pre-tuned pipeline variants. For each test image, use a simple heuristic (e.g., image standard deviation) to select the most appropriate variant. High-noise images may benefit from a stronger NLM `h`.\n\n**Critical Pitfalls & Submission Nuances**\nMistakes here will invalidate your score regardless of your model's quality.\n\n1.  **Submission Order:** **DO NOT** sort test filenames (e.g., `100.png`, `11.png`). The submission order must exactly match the order of `id`s in `sampleSubmission.csv`. Build your submission by iterating through the sample file.\n2.  **Pixel Values:** The final output values in your submission CSV must be `float`s clipped to the `[0, 1]` range. Do not submit `uint8` values from `0-255`. Use `np.clip(image, 0, 1)`.\n3.  **Image Dimensions:** **DO NOT RESIZE** or downsample the images. The RMSE is calculated pixel-wise against the original dimensions.\n4.  **Pixel Indexing:** The `id` format is `imageId_pixelId`. The `pixelId` is a flattened, row-major index (top-left to bottom-right). Ensure your `image.ravel()` or `image.reshape(-1)` output matches this order.\n5.  **Data Types & I/O:**\n    *   Always load images as grayscale: `cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)`.\n    *   For calculations and final output, convert images to `float32` and scale to `[0, 1]` via `img.astype(np.float32) / 255.0`.\n    *   For speed, many OpenCV functions like NLM and morphology expect `uint8` inputs. You can perform these steps on `uint8` images and convert to float only for the RMSE metric and final submission.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Build a working end-to-end pipeline now, validate RMSE on train vs train_cleaned, and submit predictions in the exact sampleSubmission order. Aim ≤0.04517 (bronze); pivot to a small U-Net if classical ≤0.045 isn’t reached quickly.\n\nPlan\n1) Discover and load data\n- Locate: train/, train_cleaned/, test/, sampleSubmission.csv.\n- Load grayscale; keep consistent scaling (prefer float32 in [0,1]). Confirm shapes match.\n\n2) Verify evaluation + baseline\n- RMSE = sqrt(mean((pred - target)^2)) on train vs train_cleaned. Clip predictions to [0,1].\n- Create a quick baseline (e.g., median blur) and generate submission.csv to get on the board.\n\n3) Classical pipeline (tuned for bronze)\n- Noise estimate and smoothing: median k=3/5 or fastNlMeansDenoising (uint8) with h tied to estimated sigma.\n- Edge/text preservation: build a text mask (adaptiveThreshold or Sauvola). Combine: use original where text_mask=1, smoothed background elsewhere.\n- Gentle refinement: light bilateral filter on the combined image.\n- Optional morphology: small opening/closing; white/black top-hat for background leveling (avoid halos).\n- Per-image adaptation: small grid over k/h/bilateral params; choose best by RMSE on each train image. Use sigma or simple rules to pick params on test.\n- Ensemble: average 2–3 diverse denoisers for a small boost.\n\n4) If RMSE on train > 0.045, pivot to ML\n- Simple U-Net/autoencoder (3–4 levels), train on 128–256 patches, MSE loss, flips/rotations/noise aug. 10–20 epochs often beats classical. Optionally use classical preprocessing before the net.\n\n5) Submission correctness (critical)\n- Match sampleSubmission exactly: same row count, headers (typically id,value), row-major flatten per image.\n- Ensure test image order matches sampleSubmission (don’t rely on lexicographic filename order; use numeric or the provided mapping).\n- Values clipped to [0,1]; consistent dtype. Process one image at a time to manage memory.\n\nGotchas/tricks\n- Scale/range: mixing uint8 and float without proper conversion ruins RMSE.\n- Order: any mismatch in pixel or image order invalidates the score.\n- Over-smoothing blurs strokes; always protect edges via mask or gentle filters.\n- Some images are already clean; include a “do nothing” option when variance is very low.\n- Don’t resize; keep original shape. Flatten with ravel(order=\"C\").\n- Log per-image RMSE/time; fix seeds; handle outliers with slightly different kernels.\n- Submit early; iterate with small, measured changes.\n\nActionable summary\n- Today: discover files → implement RMSE + IO → run 3–5 classical variants with text-mask combine → per-image grid on train → pick/ensemble → generate submission.csv in sample order.\n- If train RMSE ≤ 0.045, submit and refine; if > 0.045 after 1–2 iterations, implement a small U-Net with MSE and aug, retrain, and resubmit."

The id pattern shown is '110_1_1,' which might indicate an imageId of 110 and a pixel id starting at 1. The second number could be the row index. The first five ids only increment the last number, suggesting a format like \"{imageId}_{pixelId}.\" However, the presence of two underscores makes me rethink this—it seems more likely to be \"imageId_row_col.\" I'll examine the sample submission closely to ensure I'm accurately parsing the ids.**Planning image processing**\n\nFirst, I need to locate each image in the format test/{image_id}.png and compute the denoised image, then return the pixel value at [row-1, col-1] scaled from 0 to 1. That should give me the correct order! For the implementation, I’ll create a function called denoise_pipeline, focusing on non-local means as a baseline. \n\nI’ll loop over the training images to compute RMSE against the cleaned data while caching denoised images to optimize processing and avoid recomputation. Since I’m dealing with 5.7M rows, I’ll write output in chunks using a CSV writer.**Structuring the denoising process**\n\nI’m considering building a mapping from images to their denoised float arrays. Once I do that, I’ll open the output file, write the header, and compute pixel values for each ID. I need to ensure this is time-efficient, so since there are 29 test images, computing NLM for each just once should work fine.

    "outcome": "Your baseline score of 0.155 RMSE is due to lacking background normalization. The immediate path to a medal score (<0.045) is a classical image processing pipeline.\n\n**1. Core Pipeline for Immediate Implementation (Target: <0.045 RMSE)**\n\nImplement this sequence. It combines background estimation, a critical halo-prevention step, and denoising.\n\n1.  **Estimate Background:** Use morphological opening with a large elliptical kernel to capture stains while ignoring text.\n    `kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (41, 41))`\n    `background = cv2.morphologyEx(img_u8, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)`\n\n2.  **Prevent Halos:** Smooth the background estimate before normalization. This is a critical step to avoid artifacts around text.\n    `background = cv2.medianBlur(background, 21)`\n\n3.  **Normalize Illumination:** Divide the original image by the smoothed background. Work in float space and add an epsilon to prevent division by zero. Clip the result.\n    `img_norm_f = img_u8.astype(np.float32) / (background.astype(np.float32) + 1e-6)`\n    `img_norm_u8 = np.clip(img_norm_f * 255, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)`\n    *A robust alternative is to scale by the background mean: `norm = ((img_u8 / (bg+1)) * bg.mean()).clip(0,255)`*\n\n4.  **Denoise:** Apply an edge-preserving filter to the normalized `uint8` image. NLM is a strong choice, but Guided or Bilateral filters are also effective.\n    *   **NLM:** `cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(img_norm_u8, h=10)`\n    *   **Guided Filter:** `cv2.ximgproc.guidedFilter(guide=img_norm_u8, src=img_norm_u8, radius=8, eps=0.01)`\n    *   **Bilateral Filter:** `cv2.bilateralFilter(img_norm_u8, d=9, sigmaColor=50, sigmaSpace=75)`\n\n**Parameter Tuning Grid:**\n*   Morphological kernel size: [31, 41, 51]\n*   NLM `h` parameter: [8, 10, 12]\n\n**2. Advanced Techniques for Silver/Gold Push**\n\nImplement these only after the core pipeline is optimized.\n\n*   **Text-Mask Blending:** Preserve sharp text by blending the denoised background with a less-processed version of the text.\n    1.  Create a binary text mask from the normalized image using Sauvola's method (`skimage.filters.threshold_sauvola` with `window_size=25-31`, `k=0.1-0.2`) or `cv2.adaptiveThreshold`.\n    2.  Clean the mask with morphological closing/dilation.\n    3.  Combine the fully denoised image (where mask is 0) and a sharper image (e.g., the original or lightly filtered, where mask is 1).\n\n*   **Per-Image Heuristics:** Create 3-5 pre-tuned variants of your pipeline (e.g., light, medium, strong denoising). For each image, calculate a statistic like standard deviation (`np.std`) and use it to select the optimal pipeline variant.\n\n**3. Critical Traps to Avoid**\n\n*   **Halos:** Caused by morphological opening. Mitigate by using a kernel size >= 31 and, most importantly, blurring the background estimate before division.\n*   **Contrast Enhancement:** Do not use global methods like CLAHE or histogram equalization; they amplify noise and increase RMSE. A very light unsharp mask can sometimes help but must be tested carefully.\n*   **Data Types & Clipping:** Perform filtering on `uint8` images. Use `float` for normalization division. Always clip values to the valid range (`[0, 255]` or `[0, 1]`) after normalization and before final submission.\n\n**4. Deep Learning Fallback**\n\nIf classical methods stall above 0.045, a minimal U-Net is a viable path.\n*   **Architecture:** 3-4 level U-Net (e.g., 16-32-64 channels).\n*   **Data:** Train on `256x256` overlapping patches generated from the 115 training images. Use augmentation (flips, rotations, brightness).\n*   **Training:** Use MSE or L1 loss with an Adam optimizer. Can train in 1-2 hours on a GPU.\n*   **Inference:** Use a sliding window with overlap and blending to reconstruct the full test images.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: switch from NLM to a document-specific or learning-based denoiser, fix the submission file limits, add proper validation, and target ≤0.045 RMSE before full submission.\n\nStatus and gaps\n- Not on track: current RMSE ≈ 0.155; NLM is insufficient for stains/creases; no proper validation.\n- Submission blocked: CSV ~179MB exceeds 100MB.\n\nFix the submission format/size (do this first)\n- Confirm target value scale from the competition spec:\n  - If values are floats in [0,1]: clip to [0,1] and round to 3–5 decimals (e.g., f'{val:.4f}').\n  - If values are uint8 0–255: scale and cast (int(np.clip(val*255, 0, 255))).\n- Always compress: submit submission.csv.zip or submission.csv.gz.\n- Keep exact sampleSubmission order, id format image_row_col (1-based), and handle varying image sizes.\n\nValidation and metric hygiene\n- Create an 80/20 train/val split (or K-fold). Report val RMSE (same scale on both sides).\n- Normalize consistently; clip predictions to valid range; avoid destructive resizing (use tiling with overlap if needed).\n\nTwo viable paths to bronze (pick one, then iterate)\n\nA) Strong classical, document-specific pipeline (fast to implement; can reach ~0.04–0.06 RMSE)\n- Background flattening: large-kernel median/Gaussian blur to estimate bg; subtract and normalize.\n- Adaptive binarization: Sauvola or cv2.adaptiveThreshold to get a text mask.\n- Morphology: small open/close; remove tiny specks.\n- Denoise background only: NLM/Bilateral/TV on non-text regions; keep text dark, crisp.\n- Compose final: text near 0, background near 1; optional soft blend to preserve anti-aliased edges.\n- Per-image parameter selection:\n  - On train: small grid over bg kernel/sigma, Sauvola k/window, morph sizes; pick best per image by RMSE.\n  - On test: choose parameters via nearest-neighbor to train using simple features (intensity hist, mean/var, edge density).\n- Guardrails: don’t over-smooth strokes; ensure polarity (text dark).\n\nB) Learning-based denoiser (preferred for medal and beyond; can hit ≤0.03–0.04)\n- Model: small U-Net or DnCNN (single-channel), MSE loss.\n- Data: grayscale floats [0,1]; heavy augmentation (flips/rotations/brightness/contrast).\n- Training: batch 4–8; 50–100 epochs with early stopping on val RMSE; use GPU.\n- Tiling: train on 256×256 patches; infer with overlap + blending; preserve original size for submission.\n- Targets: aim val RMSE <0.04; ensemble 2–3 variants for an extra ~10% improvement.\n\nKey gotchas and tricks\n- Submission: rounding/compression are mandatory to stay under size limits.\n- Order/indexing: 1-based row/col; parse from sampleSubmission; images vary in size.\n- Overfitting risk is high (small data): validate rigorously; augment heavily.\n- Post-processing can help: light contrast normalization, adaptive thresholding, or morphology after ML output.\n- Hardware: enable CUDA to speed training/inference.\n\nActionable next steps (minimal, prioritized)\n1) Unblock submissions: implement rounding + compression; verify file size <100MB; submit current baseline to get a score.\n2) Build the document pipeline: bg subtraction → adaptive threshold → morphology → background-only denoise → compose; add per-image param selection; target val RMSE ≤0.05.\n3) Stand up a tiny U-Net/DnCNN with tiling and augmentations; train to val RMSE <0.04; clip outputs; generate compressed submission.\n4) Iterate: per-image param transfer for classical, or ensemble ML models; keep a clean val protocol and only submit when val ≤0.045."

The experts suggested background normalization and denoising, but RMSE increased.

I think the next step is to implement a guided filter or bilateral filter and text-mask blending. I could also ask for another expert review. We just received advice on adjusting the normalization formula—maybe using division and rescaling to 255 via percentile is good. Binarization seems useful to match cleaned images, aiming for an RMSE around 0.05, like what others have done on Kaggle.**Conducting exploratory data analysis**\n\nI want to inspect one of the train_cleaned images to check for unique values.

Using THRESH_BINARY will actually yield black text with a white background, which is good. However, the adaptive threshold might introduce some noise, so I'll apply morphological operations to remove tiny specks. I’ll evaluate the RMSE against the cleaned training data on the binarized results, and I’ll implement a grid search on various block sizes and constants.

The previous exploratory data analysis (EDA) indicates that cleaned images have full 0-255 values, meaning they're grayscale rather than binary. That makes me rethink the binarization approach; my earlier thoughts might have been off. The high RMSE could be due to the normalization altering levels against the ground truth. I’m considering using background subtraction as a potential solution.**Refining image normalization process**\n\nI’m looking at the known competition baseline, which involves background subtraction using a specific method, but our RMSE is quite high. I wonder if I should be comparing the float [0,1] versions of the denoised image against the cleaned uint8 image. It seems necessary to pivot to a simpler pipeline approach. I’ll use OpenCV to divide the image by the background and normalize illumination, then apply median blur and bilateral filtering for denoising. Finally, I’ll evaluate the RMSE.**Implementing evaluation functions**\n\nI need to implement an additional cell with this alternative and a grid for evaluation. Specifically, I'll add cell 6 with an evaluation function and a generation step, making sure not to auto-generate submissions until I achieve the best result.

I know the auto-grader will score it, but often, the public leaderboard score falls between 0.04 and 0.06. To improve performance, I think a guided filter variant might help reduce error, and I’m considering using cv2.ximgproc. However, I might need to install opencv-contrib-python-headless, which could conflict with the existing opencv package. It might be safer to explore edge-preserving filters instead.**Exploring processing options**\n\nI think using a slight Gaussian blur might help smooth output without hurting text edges too much, especially since the RMSE metric might favor that for cleaned grayscale images. I’m also considering applying cv2.multiply by the background mean after normalization with cv2.divide. Maybe gamma correction could help push the background values higher too. I should test different parameters for NLM, including template and search sizes. With the combinations I need to evaluate, it could take some time but seems manageable.**Implementing text-mask blending**\n\nI’m considering a simple implementation for text-mask blending by using adaptiveThreshold on a normalized image to get a mask. Then, I can blend the denoised background with the original normalized text regions, which might help reduce differences.

The consensus is that text-mask blending is the critical step to get below the 0.045 medal threshold.\n\n**1. Critical Corrections & Immediate Actions**\n*   **Stop Rounding Predictions:** In your CSV output, write the full-precision float values. Rounding can cost up to 0.001 RMSE.\n*   **Mask Polarity:** For text-mask blending, the goal is to create a mask where text is white (255). Use `cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV` on your normalized image. The correct blending logic is: `output = np.where(mask == 255, sharp_image, denoised_image)`.\n\n**2. Core Strategy: Text-Mask Blending**\nThis selectively applies your strong NLM denoiser only to the background, preserving the sharp text from the normalized image.\n\n*   **Denoised Background:** Create this using your best NLM setup: `denoised_bg = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(norm, None, h=14, templateWindowSize=5, searchWindowSize=31)`.\n*   **Text Mask:** Create the mask from the normalized image (`norm`).\n    *   **Primary Method:** `mask = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(norm, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, blockSize, C)`.\n    *   **Advanced Alternative:** `skimage.filters.threshold_sauvola` may perform better on faint text.\n*   **Sharp Text Source:** For the `sharp_image` in the blend, start with the normalized image (`norm`). For a potential small gain, try a lightly sharpened version (e.g., unsharp mask) or a lightly denoised version (NLM with `h=8`).\n*   **Composite:** `final_img = np.where(mask == 255, norm, denoised_bg)`.\n\n**3. Parameter Tuning & Experiments**\nFocus your time here.\n*   **NLM Parameters:** Your `template=5, search=31` is good. Test `h=16` (stronger denoising) vs your current `h=14`. A per-image `h` based on image standard deviation is a more advanced option if a single value isn't enough.\n*   **Masking Parameters (Grid Search):** This is your highest-leverage tuning task.\n    *   `adaptiveThreshold`: Test `blockSize` in `{23, 25, 29, 31}` and `C` in `{8, 10, 12}`.\n    *   `Sauvola`: Test `window_size` in `{25, 31}` and `k` in `{0.18, 0.22}`.\n*   **Mask Cleanup:** A simple morphological close is recommended to remove noise from the mask. Start with a 3x3 kernel. Avoid aggressive dilation.\n    *   `kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3, 3))`\n    *   `mask = cv2.morphologyEx(mask, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)`\n\n**4. What to Avoid (Consensus)**\n*   **Do Not Change Denoise Algorithm:** Stick with NLM for the background. It's your proven best performer.\n*   **Do Not Add Extra Intensity Scaling:** Your `cv2.divide(img, bg, scale=255)` is the correct approach. Do not add extra gamma or normalization steps; they are likely to increase RMSE.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: fix the submission size immediately, then shave ~0.004–0.005 RMSE via a small set of robust denoising upgrades and a simple ensemble; if still >0.045, use a lightweight patch-based regressor.\n\nConcise plan\n1) Unblock submission (critical)\n- Write smaller, numeric values: round to 3 decimals (or 2 if needed) and avoid string formatting.\n  - Example: rows.append((s, round(val, 3))) and ensure values clipped to [0,1].\n- Keep exact sampleSubmission order, ids with 1-based row/col, UTF-8 (no BOM).\n- If file still near the limit, submit submission.csv.zip (if the competition accepts zipped CSVs); otherwise stick to 3 decimals to stay < limit.\n\n2) Push RMSE below 0.045 with classical tweaks\n- Keep backbone: median background (ksize ~31) → divide normalization → NLM.\n- Fine-tune NLM:\n  - h in {12,14,15,16}, template in {3,5}, search in {31,41,51} (watch runtime).\n  - Use per-image parameter selection via a tiny grid keyed on a noise proxy (e.g., high-pass std).\n- Gentle post/aux ops (light only; avoid over-smoothing):\n  - Try CLAHE after normalization; tiny Gaussian blur (sigma ~0.5) only if it helps on holdout.\n  - Alternative/chain denoisers: BM3D (light sigma), guided filter, TV denoise; test subtle settings.\n  - Background tweaks: try Gaussian blur or morphological closing for background estimate on stain-heavy pages.\n\n3) Quick win: ensemble\n- Average 2–4 diverse outputs; start equal weights:\n  - NLM(h=14, t=5, s=31), NLM(h=12), NLM(h=16), plus one of BM3D or TV or guided.\n- Expect ~0.002–0.004 RMSE gain if components are complementary.\n\n4) Lightweight learning path (reliable bronze+)\n- Per-pixel regressor on normalized patches:\n  - Features: 7×7 or 9×9 patch, local mean/var, gradients.\n  - Model: Ridge/XGBoost/LightGBM or RandomForest on 0.5–1M sampled pixels.\n  - Predict test in tiles; clip to [0,1]. Typically reaches ~0.03–0.04 RMSE.\n- Or a tiny CNN/U-Net on 128×128 crops with MSE; use flips/rotations for augmentation.\n\n5) Validation and safety checks\n- Hold out ~20% of train to tune/weight ensembles and parameters.\n- Avoid binarization; clean targets span full grayscale.\n- Use float32 internally; pad borders; don’t over-smooth text edges.\n\nActionable checklist (do in order)\n- A) Regenerate submission: round(val, 3), numeric CSV, clip [0,1]; submit (zip only if accepted/needed).\n- B) Re-run best classical: NLM h∈{12,14,15,16}, t∈{3,5}, s∈{31,41}; pick per-image via simple rule; submit.\n- C) Add one extra denoiser (BM3D or TV or guided); average with best NLM; submit.\n- D) If RMSE still >0.045 on holdout, train a small patch regressor; submit its predictions or an ensemble with classical.\n- E) Iterate weights/params on the holdout; keep submissions minimal-precision and correctly ordered."

I'll add a new code cell for mask creation using adaptive thresholding. After that, I’ll use non-local means (NLM) for parameters and execute a grid search for tuning. It's crucial to evaluate RMSE on the training data and select the best results before generating the `submission.csv`. Then, it’s time to execute the new generator.**Coding normalization and NLM functions**\n\nI want to code a few functions today. First, I’ll create functions for normalizing and implementing non-local means (NLM), reusing estimate_background_median and normalize_divide. Next, I'll build a text mask using adaptive thresholding. If I'm using NLM, I’ll apply it depending on the sharping variant. \n\nI plan to evaluate a grid for block sizes and contrast values on the training data and generate a submission that retains floats without rounding.

If I try to execute it, it'll throw an error. My first step is to fix that syntax issue. After that, I’ll ensure that the generators write with full precision and maybe add some logging. To proceed, I’ll correct that print line now in the notebook and modify cell 13.**Preparing to modify cell content**\n\nI'm getting ready to set the cell content, but I need to provide the full source while modifying. That means I’ll have to copy the entire cell and make the necessary corrections. I’m also considering adding a quick try-except block to handle any potential issues, but I want to keep it minimal.

    "outcome": "**Synthesized Assessment & Action Plan**\n\nYour current score of 0.049001 is strong and the core pipeline (median background, `cv2.divide`, NLM) is correct. The medal is within reach through refinement, not new architectures.\n\n**Priority 1: Implement a More Robust Adaptive `h` for NLM**\nThis is the highest-impact change. Your current standard deviation approach is flawed because it confuses text contrast with noise.\n\n1.  **Use a Better Noise Estimator:** Replace `std-dev` with a Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a high-pass filtered image. This is a more robust proxy for noise.\n    ```python\n    # On the normalized uint8 image 'norm'\n    high_pass = cv2.Laplacian(norm, cv2.CV_64F) # Or norm - cv2.medianBlur(norm, 5)\n    mad = np.median(np.abs(high_pass - np.median(high_pass)))\n    sigma_hat = mad * 1.4826\n    ```\n2.  **Optimize Thresholds for RMSE:** When finding the thresholds to map `sigma_hat` to `h` values, do not optimize for classification accuracy. Instead, choose the thresholds that result in the lowest overall validation RMSE.\n3.  **`h` Candidate Set:** Start with your `{12, 14, 16}` set. Only expand it to `{10, 12, 14, 16, 18}` if your oracle analysis shows a significant number of images prefer the outer values.\n\n**Priority 2: Test Quick Post-Processing & Blending**\nThese are low-cost experiments to run on your best pipeline (either the new adaptive-`h` or your current best).\n\n1.  **Post-NLM Median Blur:** Test adding a gentle median blur *after* denoising: `denoised_final = cv2.medianBlur(denoised_image, 3)`. This is a 5-minute test that could yield a 0.001-0.002 RMSE improvement.\n2.  **Soft Blending:** Your binary mask failed. Replace it with a soft blend that preserves edges. Use a local contrast map to create weights.\n    ```python\n    # Example logic:\n    grad = cv2.Sobel(norm, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 1, ksize=3)\n    weight = np.abs(grad) / (np.max(grad) + 1e-6)\n    alpha = 0.3 # Tune this\n    blended = (1 - alpha*weight)*denoised + alpha*weight*norm\n    ```\n\n**Priority 3: Swap NLM for BM3D**\nIf the above refinements are insufficient, replace NLM with a more powerful classical filter. This has the potential for a significant score jump but is more computationally expensive.\n\n1.  **Implementation:** Use the `bm3d` library. It operates on float images in the `[0,1]` range.\n2.  **Tuning:** The key parameter is `sigma_psd`. Estimate this using the MAD method from Priority 1, scaled to the `[0,1]` range (e.g., `sigma_hat / 255`). Grid search values around your estimate, such as `{0.05, 0.07, 0.09}`.\n\n**Items to Keep Fixed / Do Not Change:**\n\n*   **`cv2.divide` Scale:** Keep `scale=255`. It is optimal.\n*   **Submission Hygiene:** Your current method of generating the submission with full-precision floats and correct ordering is perfect. Do not change it.\n*   **NLM Parameters:** Keep your best `templateWindowSize=5` and `searchWindowSize=31` fixed.\n*   **Other Filters:** Do not spend time on Wavelets or Guided Filters unless all of the above fail. BM3D is the superior choice.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Fix the submission-size blocker, run per-image adaptive parameters, and apply a few small, safe tweaks to cut RMSE by ~0.004.\n\nStatus\n- Best CV RMSE: 0.049001; Bronze cutoff: 0.04517 (gap ≈ 0.003831, ~8.5%).\n- Submission failure: file too large (167 MB; limit ~100–104 MB).\n\nDo this immediately (file size)\n- Write fewer decimals: format predictions with 4–6 decimals (e.g., f'{val:.5f}' or .4f). This typically shrinks 40–50% with negligible score hit.\n- Ensure no extra index/whitespace/dtype bloat; match sampleSubmission order exactly.\n- If allowed, zip the CSV; otherwise stick to 4–6 decimals.\n\nCore RMSE improvement\n- Execute per-image adaptive h (Cell 13; based on image std). This is the likeliest ~0.0005–0.004 gain needed to reach bronze.\n\nIf still short (simple, fast adaptivity)\n- Per-image background kernel size: choose ksize_bg from {27, 31, 35} via a simple std-based rule.\n- Per-image NLM params: tmpl ∈ {5, 7}, srch ∈ {21, 31}; also test h ∈ {11, 13, 14}. Keep 2–3 bins to avoid overfitting.\n- Light photometric match: percentile stretch using p1/p99 per image, linear remap to [0,1], then clip.\n\nStronger fallback\n- Try BM3D in place of NLM after normalization: sigma ≈ 0.06–0.10; keep float [0,1] pipeline.\n\nGotchas to avoid slips\n- No resizing; preserve geometry.\n- Output floats in [0,1]; clip; do not binarize.\n- Use 3–6 decimals only; avoid hidden quantization later.\n- Determinism: fix seeds; keep OpenCV on uint8 until final float clip.\n- Stream I/O; don’t build full-pixel lists; verify all test IDs exist.\n\nAction plan (minimal changes first)\n1) Regenerate your current best (divide + NLM: h=14, tmpl=5, srch=31) with 4–6 decimal outputs; submit to confirm pass and baseline.\n2) Run Cell 13 (per-image h); output with 4–6 decimals; submit.\n3) If >0.045: add per-image ksize_bg and tmpl/srch/h binning; submit.\n4) Add p1–p99 remap; submit.\n5) If still >0.045: swap NLM for BM3D (sigma 0.06–0.10); submit.\n6) Optional: weighted ensemble of top variants if gains are marginal."

    "llm_json": "**Planning actions for submission**\n\nI need to proceed with some adjustments. The current expert advice suggests using MAD on high-pass instead of standard deviation and limiting decimal places in the submission file to 4-6, especially since the existing submission.csv is quite large at 167MB. I'll need to regenerate this file with 5 decimals to meet the Kaggle limit of 100-104MB. My first step is to edit cell 13 to implement the MAD estimator, optimizing thresholds based on RMSE, then execute it.**Modifying the denoising process**\n\nI want to replace the standard approach functions with a high-pass method and compute sigma_hat using MAD. I’ll fit thresholds by searching t1 and t2 over percentiles, while also calculating RMSE. However, processing 115 images with 21 threshold pairs for each evaluation is heavy. Instead, I can create a per_img list for each image, containing sigma_hat and RMSEs for each candidate h to calculate assignment RMSE quickly without re-denoising. Finally, I'll implement noise_sigma to compute Laplacian CV_32F and MAD.**Planning submission adjustments**\n\nI’m thinking about converting to float values on a raw scale since thresholds are relative. I want to define functions like eval_per_image_errs to return details about paths, sigma, errors for each h, and best values. There’s also fit_thresholds_min_rmse to generate percentiles of sigma and perform a grid search for t1 and t2 to minimize mean RMSE. \n\nAdditionally, I’ll implement generate_submission_per_image_h with a sigma estimator for h selection while considering an optional post-NLM median blur. Finally, I need to ensure the CSV file has limited decimals to reduce file size, using a format like f'{val:.5f}'.

    "outcome": "Your NLM-based pipeline has reached its performance ceiling at 0.049001 RMSE. The consensus is that replacing NLM with BM3D is the highest-priority action and your most direct path to a medal-winning score (<0.045).\n\n**Primary Action: Implement BM3D**\n\n1.  **Install:** `%pip install bm3d`\n2.  **Pipeline:** Keep your current pipeline core but swap NLM for BM3D.\n    *   `bg = cv2.medianBlur(img_u8, ksize=31)`\n    *   `norm_u8 = cv2.divide(img_u8, bg, scale=255)`\n    *   `norm_f = norm_u8.astype(np.float32) / 255.0`\n    *   `denoised_f = bm3d.bm3d(norm_f, sigma_psd=..., stage_arg=bm3d.BM3DStages.ALL_STAGES)`\n    *   `output_u8 = (denoised_f * 255).clip(0, 255).astype(np.uint8)`\n3.  **Critical Parameter (`sigma_psd`):** The choice of `sigma_psd` is crucial. The recommended approach is per-image estimation.\n\n    *   **Strategy 1 (Recommended): Per-Image Sigma Estimation**\n        This is the most promising method. For each normalized float image (`norm_f`):\n        1.  Estimate noise: `hp = cv2.Laplacian(norm_f, cv2.CV_32F)` followed by `sigma_hat = 1.4826 * np.median(np.abs(hp - np.median(hp)))`.\n        2.  Clamp the estimate to a reasonable range: `sigma_psd = np.clip(sigma_hat, 0.03, 0.12)`.\n        3.  Feed this per-image `sigma_psd` into `bm3d.bm3d()`.\n        4.  For validation, you can test a small grid of multipliers (e.g., `{0.8, 1.0, 1.2} * sigma_psd`) to find the optimal policy.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2 (Simpler Alternative): Global Sigma Grid Search**\n        If per-image estimation is complex, find the best single `sigma_psd` for all images by testing the grid: `[0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06]`.\n\n**Secondary Experiments (Low Priority)**\n\nAttempt these only if the primary BM3D strategy is insufficient:\n*   **Adaptive Background `ksize`:** Try selecting `ksize` from `{27, 31, 35}` per image.\n*   **Soft Blending:** Blend the denoised output with the normalized input using gradient-based weights.\n*   **Divide Scale:** Test `cv2.divide` scales other than 255 (e.g., 127).\n\n**What to Stop Doing**\n\n*   **Do not** tune NLM parameters further.\n*   **Do not** apply any post-denoising filters (e.g., `medianBlur`).\n*   **Do not** pre-filter the image before BM3D.\n*   **Do not** use hard-mask blending or complex contrast stretching.\n\n**Runtime Strategy**\n\n*   Cache the normalized images (`norm_f`) to disk to avoid re-computing them.\n*   Use your validation set to find the single best strategy (e.g., the best sigma multiplier or the best global sigma).\n*   Apply that one fixed pipeline to all test images for submission. Runtime should be well within limits.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: fix submission size, then upgrade denoising and parameter selection to close ~0.004 RMSE gap (0.0490 → ≤0.04517).\n\nImmediate fixes (unblock scoring)\n- Regenerate CSV with 3–4 decimals (prefer 4). Aim <100–104MB. No scientific notation quirks. Optionally zip if grader allows.\n- Ensure: exact sampleSubmission order; no extra/missing rows; no duplicates; values are float in [0,1]; no resizing/cropping.\n- If writing via code, stream in chunks and format values with {:.3f} or {:.4f}.\n\nCore pipeline to reach Bronze\n- Keep median-blur background + divide normalization, but do all math in float32/64; avoid uint8 after normalization.\n- Denoiser upgrade (primary):\n  - Use BM3D on normalized float: test sigma_psd ∈ {0.04, 0.06, 0.08}; pick via global CV, then per-image by MAD-based sigma.\n  - If BM3D unavailable: use skimage.restoration.denoise_nl_means on float (fast_mode=True, patch_size=5, patch_distance 6–8, h ≈ 0.6–1.0·sigma).\n- Two-stage denoising (if staying with OpenCV NLM):\n  - Light pre-denoise → background normalize → stronger denoise.\n  - Tune NLM h per-image using noise estimated on the normalized image (MAD/std of high-frequency).\n- Adaptive background:\n  - Choose median kernel by image stain level (e.g., ksize ≈ 31/41/51 based on std); optionally blend outputs from multiple ksizes.\n- Precision hygiene:\n  - Preserve float through normalize/divide and denoiser; clip to [0,1] only at the end. Avoid extra post-blurs.\n\nCompetition gotchas\n- Never resize; maintain original geometry.\n- No binarization; full grayscale targets.\n- Guard against divide halos with a small background floor.\n- Ensembling/post-filters yield ≤0.0005—don’t rely on them for the 0.004 gap.\n\nActionable plan\n1) Fix CSV size: regenerate submission with 4 (or 3) decimals; recheck ordering, row count, and range.\n2) Implement float pipeline: img_f ∈ [0,1] → median-blur bg (u8) → norm_f = img_f / max(bg/255, 1/255) → clip.\n3) Swap denoiser to BM3D; grid sigma {0.04, 0.06, 0.08}; select per-image via MAD. Rescore.\n4) If BM3D not possible, use skimage NLM on norm_f, tuned to sigma; or OpenCV two-stage NLM with adaptive h.\n5) Add adaptive background kernel sizing; optionally test local adaptive processing if time remains."

    "llm_json": "**Implementing BM3D**\n\nI need to get started with implementing BM3D. The first step is to add the bm3d package and set up the functions for the BM3D pipeline. I'm considering evaluating the sigma strategy for training, either through per-image MAD with a grid of multipliers or using a global grid. Experts suggest per-image estimation, so I’ll implement that by calculating sigma_hat for each image. I anticipate running about 345 BM3D evaluations, but the image size should make it manageable. I'll also ensure the bm3d package is installed.**Setting up BM3D in Notebook**\n\nI need to insert a new cell to set up BM3D. The steps are to install the bm3d package, define necessary functions, run evaluations, and print the results. If everything looks good, I’ll generate a submission with per-image sigma based on the best multiplier, choosing the one with the lowest mean RMSE. I’m also ensuring the submission has 4-5 decimal points for size consideration. I’ll use the %pip magic command to install bm3d, then implement several functions to handle noise and evaluations accordingly.**Calculating and Submitting BM3D Results**\n\nI need to compute sums to find means for each factor. It’s also important to evaluate a simple global sigma grid, like [0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08], as a baseline. After that, I’ll print the best results. \n\nI’ll implement a function for generating submissions, allowing options for decimal places and whether to use per-image or a global sigma. After inserting a cell for this, I’ll import the necessary bm3d functions and ensure to log performance every 10 images, converting to float for RMSE calculations at the end.**Preparing for RMSE Calculation**\n\nI’ve realized that our output is float in the range [0,1] if we keep den_f, which makes it easier to compute the RMSE using rmse(den_f, target_f). I’ll write the code based on that. For the submission, the den_f array will be in float format directly using those values, and I'll make sure to format everything to five decimal places. Now, it's time to insert the necessary code for this step.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 16,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# BM3D implementation: replace NLM with BM3D on normalized float images\",\n      \"%pip install -q bm3d\",\n      \"import bm3d\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def normalize_divide_float(img_u8: np.ndarray, ksize_bg: int = 31) -> np.ndarray:\",\n      \"    bg = estimate_background_median(img_u8, ksize=ksize_bg)\",\n      \"    bg_safe = bg.copy()\",\n      \"    bg_safe[bg_safe < 1] = 1\",\n      \"    norm_u8 = cv2.divide(img_u8, bg_safe, scale=255)  #

I wonder if normalization might be an issue. Given our timeline, we should consider BM3D submission only if there's improvement, but it's not helping. The best still seems to be NLM at 0.049001, but we need to lower it to medal. Alternative methods, like using skimage restoration, could be a better route. I think combining BM3D and NLM with edge-preserving blending might help reduce RMSE, but time is tight.**Implementing Soft Blending**\n\nI think it's time to try the soft blending technique I mentioned earlier, using gradient-based weighting between the best denoised output from NLM and the normalized input. I'm hoping this might reduce the RMSE by about 0.004. Since the text-mask blending didn’t yield results, soft blending could be more effective. I’ll set up a new cell to compute the normalization, denoise with NLM, and apply the blending formula. I’ll evaluate weights using alpha values between 0.2 and 0.4, and if the results improve to below 0.049, we can proceed with submission.

Our best threshold is still 0.049001, while the bronze threshold is 0.045. I’m considering seeking expert advice again or trying alternatives like skimage NLM or tweaking normalization. Experts mentioned that our implementation of BM3D might be flawed; we used cv2.divide that could have lost precision because of converting to uint8. I think we should recompute using float normalization and re-evaluate BM3D with a lower sigma range. Also, I need to look into noise estimation methods as well.**Modifying BM3D tests**\n\nI need to quickly change the normalization and test BM3D with global sigmas ranging from 0.015 to 0.04, and for per-image factors of 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0. I should calculate sigma_hat using the MAD from the high-pass median filter difference instead of Laplacian since that can amplify edges. I’m thinking of implementing these changes in cell 16 or creating a new cell 18. Running each global grid takes about 4 minutes, so I'll start with a smaller set of sigmas to save time. Let’s see if we can get closer to that desired threshold!**Implementing functions for BM3D**\n\nI need to create a new cell to define the `normalize_divide_float_precise` and `estimate_sigma_mad_float_hpf` functions using a high-pass filter from norm_f minus the median blur with k=5 in float. I can use cv2.medianBlur on the uint8 version first and then convert it back to float for division. Alternatively, I could also try cv2.GaussianBlur on float, since OpenCV supports CV_32F.

That's better than 0.049001, but still above our bronze target of 0.04517. Should I submit this file to see the leaderboard versus cross-validation? The rule says not to submit until I'm confident about earning a medal, but we’re under pressure to win. My current CV is 0.0488, which is still higher than bronze, yet sometimes LB can surprise. I should probably submit to establish a baseline.**Analyzing submission strategy**\n\nI need to clarify that the auto-grader will evaluate against the official test set and that medal thresholds are based on the leaderboard. If I don’t submit now, I won't know where I stand. The goal is to win a medal, and if I submit and it doesn’t achieve that, I can tweak and resubmit if multiple submissions are allowed. However, the \"submit_final_answer\" might be the only final submission for this task, which complicates things. The next improvement could involve combining adaptive bg-ksize with the best NLM parameters.**Exploring improvement techniques**\n\nI'm considering a few tweaks for improving the model. One option is applying a percentile stretch on normalized images before using NLM, which was suggested earlier. That might offer a slight improvement. Instead of using cv2.divide for normalization, I could try float normalization before converting back to uint8, which might work similarly. Another thought is clipping extreme bright pixels before running NLM, though I'm not sure it will help. I should implement a per-image templateWindowSize selection of either 5 or 7 and use the same metric for testing thresholds that could further reduce RMSE.**Planning error evaluation**\n\nI need to collect errors for template sizes 5 and 7 and fit a single threshold to make a choice. There’s also an option to vary searchWindowSize between 21 and 31, but previous tests consistently showed better results with 31, so I'll stick with that. I'll create a new cell to gather per-image errors for each template candidate. If that improves things, I’ll consider combining adaptive bg-ksize and per-image templates, though that complicates the process. It might be simpler to use a fixed bg ksize of 31 with a per-image template selection instead. Given the diminishing returns, I think it’s time to request an expert review to strategize the next steps efficiently.**Requesting expert review**\n\nI need to provide the current cross-validation scores and ask for one tweak that could bring the score under 0.045, though that seems unlikely. Earlier, I needed to return a single action JSON, so I’ll go with requesting an expert review. I’ll explain concisely and ask if techniques like total variation denoising (using skimage.restoration.denoise_tv_chambolle) can outperform NLM. That method can work well sometimes. I’ll also ask about using skimage.nl_means on float or if per-image selection of bg ksize and h could help. Additionally, I'm curious about the typical CV-LB gap, so let’s get that expert insight.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Status: Best CV mean RMSE now 0.048763 using per-image adaptive background ksize {27,31,35} with thresholds on stain metric (std of normalized), NLM h=14, tmpl=5, srch=31.

BM3D (float pipelines, two variants) underperformed (best ~0.05116). A 5-decimal submission.csv has been generated for both fixed and adaptive bg-ksize pipelines (size constraint solved).

Options I consider: (a) per-image joint selection of (bg ksize, NLM h) with a single 2-threshold policy on one metric; (b) per-image templateWindowSize {5,7} selection; (c) skimage.restoration total-variation denoise on normalized float (TV Chambolle or Bregman) tuned by weight; (d) skimage float NLM (fast_mode, patch_size=5, patch_distance ~7) tuned by h relative to sigma. 2) Are there known tricks specific to DDD (e.g., percentile stretch p1/p99 before/after divide, small background floor) that typically yield ~0.003-0.004? 3) Should we abandon BM3D here (consistent underperformance) or try a tiny sigma band (0.01-0.02) with float-only normalization? 4) If pursuing joint per-image selection, advise simple metric and candidate sets that won\\u2019t overfit with 115 images, and whether to rely on oracle cache + RMSE thresholding like we did for bg-ksize.

    "outcome": "### Overall Assessment\nYour current adaptive background ksize pipeline (CV 0.04876) is a solid improvement over the fixed baseline (0.04900), but it is not yet at the bronze medal level (≤0.045). The consensus is that you are on the correct path, but the final ~0.003-0.004 RMSE gain requires upgrading your core pipeline and integrating known competition-winning tricks. Your methodical experimentation is a key strength; now, focus on executing the highest-ROI plan.\n\n### Critical Consensus & Directives\n1.  **Abandon BM3D Immediately:** Your experiments have definitively proven it is inferior to NLM for this dataset. Further time spent here is wasted.\n2.  **Implement \"DDD Tricks\":** These are non-negotiable for closing the final gap.\n    *   **Percentile Stretch:** After denoising, rescale the image intensity by mapping the 1st and 99th percentiles to the full [0, 1] range. This is the single most critical trick.\n    *   **Background Floor:** When dividing by the background, add a small floor (e.g., `bg = np.maximum(bg, 5/255.0)`) to prevent division-by-zero artifacts in dark regions.\n\n### Synthesized Action Plan: The Medal Shot\nExecute the following two-step plan. This synthesizes the recommendations into the highest-probability path to a score <0.045.\n\n**Step 1: Upgrade to a Float-Based Pipeline with Contrast Stretch**\nRefactor your pipeline to perform all key operations in float space for higher precision. This is the fundamental upgrade needed.\n\n1.  **Normalization:** Convert the image and background to `float32` *before* division. Apply the background floor trick here.\n    `norm_f = np.clip((img_f / bg_f_safe), 0.0, 1.0)`\n2.  **NLM on Float Data:** Apply `cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising` to the float-normalized image. Note that the `h` parameter will now be a small float value representing noise standard deviation, not a large integer.\n3.  **Grid Search `h_float`:** Run a validation grid search on this new `h` parameter. Start with `[0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12]`, keeping `ksize=31` fixed.\n4.  **Percentile Stretch:** Apply the percentile stretch to the denoised float output before converting back to `uint8`.\n\nThis new float-based pipeline with a tuned `h_float` and percentile stretch should, by itself, significantly lower your CV score.\n\n**Step 2: Implement Joint Adaptive Selection on the New Float Pipeline**\nOnce the float pipeline from Step 1 is established and validated, re-integrate your successful adaptive policy logic, but make it more powerful.\n\n1.  **Joint Parameters:** Adaptively select the optimal pair of `(bg_ksize, h_float)` per image.\n2.  **Candidate Set:** Use a grid like `bg_ksize` in `{27, 31, 35}` and `h_float` in `{0.08, 0.10, 0.12}` (or your best values from Step 1).\n3.  **Improved Metric:** Use a metric more sensitive to noise than simple standard deviation. MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) on a high-pass filtered version of the image is a superior choice.\n4.  **Fit Policy:** Use your existing oracle cache methodology to find the optimal thresholds on the MAD metric that assign each image to the best `(ksize, h)` pair.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- **Efficiency:** Cache intermediate normalizations to disk to speed up grid searches.\n- **Submission:** Continue generating 5-decimal precision submissions to meet size constraints.\n- **Alternative Denoising:** If the above plan fails to break 0.045, your next pivot should be to Total Variation (TV) denoising, not back to BM3D.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** "
