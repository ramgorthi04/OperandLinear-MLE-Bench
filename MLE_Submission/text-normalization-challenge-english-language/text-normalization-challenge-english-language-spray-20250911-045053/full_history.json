The initial code will focus on loading data from a zip file, inspecting it, and setting up a baseline model. From my past experience, I remember that normalizing text involves several fields like id, sentence_id, and tokens. In this competition, we’re predicting 'after' for all tokens with specific conditions for normalization. I'll set up preprocessing rules based on training data and explore using gradient boosting for efficiency.**Developing mapping strategies**\n\nI’m exploring different approaches for mapping tokens from \"before\" to \"after\" based on their class. I think I can use a mapping dictionary from the training data, with a backoff to identity and simple rules for numbers and letters. To achieve high accuracy, ideally around 0.99, a baseline frequency dictionary might already be close. I'll start with exploratory data analysis and create notebook cells for planning, data imports, and loading datasets. We'll compute mappings using groupby, applying those to the test data, and set rules for handling punctuation, ensuring proper mapping for characters like '.'.**Preparing the submission file**\n\nI need to create a `submission.csv` that includes columns like id and after, and maybe also include 'sentence_id' and 'token_id'. First, I should inspect a sample submission file to see its structure. The initial step is to open the files and load some headers. I’ll write code to read the head of the sample submission, then insert that into my notebook.

I should use the request_expert_review tool, providing the notebook path and specific questions about the baseline approaches I've outlined, considering how to handle special classes and empty tokens.**Requesting a fast recipe**\n\nI'm looking for a quick recipe to achieve a performance measure of ≥0.991. My plan involves using mappings and backoff rules for number normalization with pynum2words, plus offline installation of num2words. I know the competition likely expects deterministic grammars, but I think we can work with mappings and identities. Many top solutions use WFST or XGBoost along with character features. I’ll propose a pipeline: load the full training data, extract frequent mappings, and a backoff strategy—that should give us a solid approach. I'll also ask experts if this is enough to get us a medal!**Closing the gap efficiently**\n\nIf gaps remain, I should suggest key rules to handle numbers, ordinals, decimals, fractions, currencies, times, dates, abbreviations, and letters—all potentially using simple regex-based processors. I wonder if we should consider any test-based leakage, but that might not be feasible. I'll need to seek expert advice, specifically on efficiency tips, to refine our approach.

Plan to stream in chunks and aggregate with groupby value_counts; confirm chunk sizes and keys to avoid memory spikes. 5) Any must-do preprocessing (lowercasing, stripping) or it harms accuracy? 6) Submission gotcha checks beyond matching sample: ensure full coverage and correct id ordering.

The problem comes from checking if `max(v)[1] == b` when `b` is `pd.NA`. Since comparing `pd.NA` yields ambiguity, I wonder if I should cast `b` and `a` to Python strings. However, it's better to filter out missing values early on. I also think dropping `NA` during the `cnt.update` process sounds safer, especially when building the mask to identify valid entries.**Modifying code implementation**\n\nI can bypass building the unchanged set to quickly avoid errors, but I think keeping it can also be fine. I need to edit cell 1 to ensure during the chunk loop, rows where both before and after are not `na` are filtered out. This means I’ll avoid ambiguous equality by ensuring `b` isn't `pd.NA`. Since we've filtered, `b` should be fine. I could also rewrite the unchanged computation to check frequencies instead. Let's adjust the chunk loop accordingly, dropping `na` values to improve efficiency.**Preparing to execute cell**\n\nI need to edit the cell first, following the instruction about using one tool per turn. So for now, I'll focus on making those modifications. Once I've crafted the modified cell source, I can then move on to executing it in the next turn.
