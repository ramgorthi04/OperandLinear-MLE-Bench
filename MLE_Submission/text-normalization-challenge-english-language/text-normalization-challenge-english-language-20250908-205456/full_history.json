The workflow suggests using these reviews at major checkpoints. I want to get feedback on our plan, data format, and specifics of the baseline approach for the competition. We need to address how to predict 'after' from 'before', since the test set lacks class labels. It's essential to infer the connections effectively.**Exploring per-class model approach**\n\nI'm considering a very strong approach using a per-class model with gradient boosted trees to turn string features into 'after' text. Typically, I first predict the semiotic class and decide whether to retain it. For deterministic classes like PLAIN and PUNCT, 'after' usually matches 'before,' with punctuation mapped accordingly. From earlier samples, many tokens show identity. We should ask the experts for advice on rule coverage, recommended libraries, and strategies for handling out-of-vocabulary cases. Requesting that expert review is a key next step!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Plan and initial EDA completed.

Goal: achieve >=0.991 (medal). Requesting guidance on high-scoring baseline and roadmap: 1) Recommended pipeline to reach ~0.993+: (a) Predict class for test tokens? Or avoid explicit class prediction via direct normalization rules with fallbacks? (b) Strong heuristics/rules per class (CARDINAL, ORDINAL, DECIMAL, FRACTION, MONEY, DATE, TIME, MEASURE, TELEPHONE, ELECTRONIC, ADDRESS, LETTERS, VERBATIM, PUNCT/PLAIN). 2) Essential rule coverage order and pitfalls for English track to cross 0.991 quickly. 3) Whether to use a classifier for class prediction (e.g., LightGBM on character/regex/context features) vs pure deterministic routing using regex detectors; best features if training a class model. 4) For rendering numbers/dates/times/money: preferred libraries (inflect/num2words/dateutil/dateparser/pint) and any locale settings that match competition ground truth. 5) CV strategy: group by sentence_id? Any leakage concerns? 6) Backoff priority: identity mapping, training frequency lookup of (class,before)->after vs (before)->after; handling ambiguous tokens like May/US/1,000. 7) Known edge cases: hyphens, ranges, commas, trailing punctuation, capitalization rules, apostrophes, letter sequences, URLs/emails, file paths, hashtags, version numbers. 8) Runtime tips to keep it fast (dataset ~292 MB train, 15 MB test).

    "outcome": "**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (NEXT 2 HOURS):**\n1.  **Create Baseline:** `df_test['after'] = df_test['before']`. This scores ~0.95 and verifies your submission pipeline.\n2.  **Add Frequency Lookup:** Build a `(class, before) -> after` lookup from the training data using the most frequent `after` value.\n3.  **Implement Validation:** Use `sklearn.model_selection.GroupKFold` grouped by `sentence_id` to create a reliable local CV.\n4.  **Submit:** Confirm your baseline works on the leaderboard.\n\n**MEDAL-WINNING STRATEGY (TARGET: 0.993+):**\nA high-precision, rule-based pipeline with train-derived memorization is sufficient for a medal. Do not build a complex ML classifier initially; it is a secondary optimization for routing if rules plateau below 0.991.\n\n**PIPELINE IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (PRIORITY HIGH TO LOW):**\n\n1.  **Memorization (Highest Priority):** Apply before any rules. This is critical for sparse, idiosyncratic classes (ELECTRONIC, VERBATIM, ADDRESS, TELEPHONE).\n    *   **Context Lookup:** Create a dictionary `(prev_token, current_token, next_token) -> after`. Use it for mappings that are unique in the training data.\n    *   **Token Lookup:** Create a dictionary `token -> after` for tokens where one `after` form appears with high frequency (e.g., >95% of the time with support >3). Exclude common alphabetic words to avoid overriding PLAIN class.\n\n2.  **Deterministic Rules (Apply in this order):**\n    *   **PUNCT:** Map punctuation to \"sil\" or as observed in train data.\n    *   **MONEY:** Detect currency symbols ($, £, €). Use `num2words` or `inflect` for the number, then construct the phrase (e.g., \"$3.50\" -> \"three dollars fifty cents\"). Handle integer, decimal, and cents-only cases.\n    *   **DECIMAL/PERCENT:** For \"X.Y\", convert to \"X point <digit-by-digit Y>\". Append \"percent\" if `%` is present.\n    *   **TIME:** Use regex for patterns like HH:MM(:SS) am/pm. Convert to words (e.g., \"12:45\" -> \"twelve forty-five\"). Check train data for \"oh\" vs \"zero\" usage (e.g., \"9:05\" -> \"nine oh five\").\n    *   **DATE:** Use regex for common patterns (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, `Mon DD, YYYY`). Use `dateutil` or `dateparser` as a fallback. Render to match train style (e.g., \"May 5, 2010\" -> \"may fifth twenty ten\").\n    *   **MEASURE:** Detect number + unit (e.g., 6ft, 150lb). Normalize the number and expand the unit from a train-derived lexicon (ft->feet, lb->pounds).\n    *   **ORDINAL:** Detect `\\d+(st|nd|rd|th)`. Convert using `num2words(..., to='ordinal')`.\n    *   **CARDINAL:** For integer-like tokens, remove commas and convert to words.\n        ```python\n        # Example CARDINAL rule\n        if re.match(r'^[0-9,]+$', token):\n            num = int(token.replace(',',''))\n            return num2words.num2words(num)\n        ```\n    *   **LETTERS:** For short, all-caps tokens (e.g., \"USA\"), spell out the letters (\"u s a\").\n    *   **ELECTRONIC/TELEPHONE/ADDRESS/VERBATIM:** Rely primarily on memorization. For unseen tokens, fall back to character-by-character spelling, verbalizing symbols (\".\", \"@\", \"/\").\n\n3.  **Default (Lowest Priority):**\n    *   **PLAIN:** Identity mapping (`after = before`). This is your final backstop and protects your score on the most common class.\n\n**BACKOFF HIERARCHY:**\nFor any given token, apply the first successful transformation from this list:\n1.  Context-based memorization lookup\n2.  High-confidence token memorization lookup\n3.  Deterministic rules (in the order listed above)\n4.  Identity mapping (PLAIN)\n\n**VALIDATION & LIBRARIES:**\n*   **CV:** Use 5-fold `GroupKFold` on `sentence_id`. Target a per-fold accuracy >0.991.\n*   **Libraries:** Use `num2words==0.5.12` (stable) or `inflect`. Pre-compile regexes for speed. Gate slow libraries like `dateparser` with fast regex checks first.\n\n**IF YOU STALL (<0.991):**\nAdd a lightweight classifier (LightGBM/CatBoost) to *predict the class* and route the token to the correct rule function.\n*   **Features:** Token properties (length, case, is_digit, has_symbol), char n-grams, and context features (properties of previous/next tokens).\n*   **Purpose:** Improve routing for ambiguous tokens (e.g., \"st\" as in \"1st\" vs \"St.\"). The final text is still generated by your deterministic rules.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: reach ≥0.99038 accuracy (bronze), ≥0.99135 (silver), ≥0.99724 (gold). You currently have no submission; move from EDA to execution immediately.\n\nWhat to do now (today)\n- Create a submission fast\n  - Identity baseline: after = before for all test tokens; write submission.csv with columns [id, after], where id = \"{sentence_id}_{token_id}\".\n  - In parallel, build a stronger baseline with sentence-grouped CV (by sentence_id): majority map before → most frequent after from train; fallback to identity; estimate CV accuracy. Expect ~0.988–0.992 if done well.\n- Submit to get an initial score and verify file format.\n\nBuild toward bronze/silver (next)\n- Keep sentence_id-grouped CV; log overall and by-pattern errors.\n- Majority map + minimal high-impact rules applied only when no exact majority match:\n  - Numbers: integers, signed, decimals → words (“point” style for decimals).\n  - Ordinals: 1st/2nd/3rd/4th → first/second/third/fourth; handle 11th–13th.\n  - Fractions: 1/2, 3/4 → one half, three quarters.\n  - Time: HH:MM, HH:MMam/pm → “twelve oh five”, append “a m”/“p m” per train style.\n  - Money: $/£/€ with cents → “twelve dollars, thirty-four cents”; handle commas.\n  - Measures/units: 6ft, 150lb, 10km, 3.5kg, %, mph, °C/°F → expand units (feet, pounds, kilometers, kilograms, percent, miles per hour, degrees celsius/fahrenheit).\n  - Acronyms/LETTERS: all-caps tokens length ≥2 → spaced letters (“a b c”).\n  - PLAIN/PUNCT: usually identity; handle “sil” only if seen in train pairs.\n- Test lacks class: infer via regex/heuristics embedded in rules; only train a lightweight classifier (char n-grams, length, regex flags) if needed as a backoff.\n- Iterate: inspect validation errors where pred != after; add/adjust targeted rules. Aim for CV ≥0.991 before finalizing.\n\nAdvanced (if stalled below 0.9904)\n- Add ML backoff (e.g., CatBoost) using token/regext/neighbor features.\n- Consider seq2seq (T5/BART) fine-tune as a hybrid fallback for tricky classes.\n\nTools and checks\n- Libraries: num2words, inflect, regex, sklearn; optional catboost/lightgbm.\n- Case handling: use exact before match first; consider lowercase-backoff map for unseen forms.\n- Edge cases: commas in numbers, signed values, leading zeros in times, currency spacing.\n- Submission hygiene: correct id format; two columns only.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Today: build majority-map baseline with sentence-level CV, generate submission.csv; submit. Target CV ≥0.990.\n- Next: add focused rules for numbers, ordinals, decimals, fractions, time, money, measures, acronyms; keep majority-first, rules as fallback; iterate via error analysis to CV ≥0.991.\n- Verify formatting and edge cases; then submit for bronze or better."

I’ve got plenty of RAM (234GB), so I can handle the 291MB train CSV either in chunks or all at once. The tasks include loading the train data, creating a frequency map (and possibly a context map), and executing 5-fold CV using sentence IDs. I'll start with a simple token-level majority map for efficiency and then build the submission file.**Implementing prediction model**\n\nI’m planning to add a new code cell that will load the training DataFrame first. I’ll build a token majority map with a threshold—possibly above 0—to handle common tokens, but I need to be careful with ambiguous words like \"May.\" The idea is to avoid overriding plain words, which might confuse things. I’ll set up a CV loop with GroupKFold to compute accuracy per fold, build the majority map, and then predict using that map before training on the full dataset for submission.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 3,\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n    \"source\": [\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"from collections import Counter, defaultdict\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold\",\n      \"from datetime import datetime\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def log(msg):\",\n      \"    print(f\\\"[{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] {msg}\\\", flush=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"train_path = 'en_train.csv.zip'\",\n      \"log('Loading full train...')\",\n      \"df_train = pd.read_csv(train_path)\",\n      \"log(f\\\"Train shape: {df_train.shape}; cols={list(df_train.columns)}\\\")\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def build_majority_map(df):\",\n      \"    # For each 'before', choose most frequent 'after'\",\n      \"    counts = df.groupby(['before','after']).size().reset_index(name='cnt')\",\n      \"    idx = counts.groupby('before')['cnt'].idxmax()\",\n      \"    best = counts.loc[idx, ['before','after','cnt']]\",\n      \"    mapping = dict(zip(best['before'], best['after']))\",\n      \"    return mapping, best['cnt'].sum(), len(mapping)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def infer_with_map(series_before, mapping):\",\n      \"    # Vectorized map with fallback to identity\",\n      \"    return series_before.map(mapping).fillna(series_before)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"log('5-fold GroupKFold CV by sentence_id...')\",\n      \"gkf = GroupKFold(n_splits=5)\",\n      \"groups = df_train['sentence_id'].values\",\n      \"fold_acc = []\",\n      \"for fold, (tr_idx, va_idx) in enumerate(gkf.split(df_train, groups=groups), 1):\",\n      \"    t0 = datetime.now()\",\n      \"    dtr = df_train.iloc[tr_idx]\",\n      \"    dva = df_train.iloc[va_idx]\",\n      \"    mapping, total_cnt, uniq = build_majority_map(dtr[['before','after']])\",\n      \"    dva_pred = infer_with_map(dva['before'], mapping)\",\n      \"    acc = (dva_pred.values == dva['after'].values).mean()\",\n      \"    fold_acc.append(acc)\",\n      \"    dt = (datetime.now()-t0).total_seconds()\",\n      \"    log(f\\\"Fold {fold}: acc={acc:.6f}, uniq_before={uniq}, build_cnt_sum={total_cnt}, time={dt:.2f}s\\\")\",\n      \"log(f\\\"CV mean acc: {np.mean(fold_acc):.6f} \\u00b1 {np.std(fold_acc):.6f}\\\")\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Fit on full train and generate test predictions\",\n      \"log('Fitting majority map on full train...')\",\n      \"major_map, total_cnt, uniq = build_majority_map(df_train[['before','after']])\",\n      \"log(f\\\"Major map size={uniq}, total_cnt={total_cnt}\\\")\",\n      \"\",\n      \"log('Loading test and predicting...')\",\n      \"df_test = pd.read_csv('en_test_2.csv.zip')\",\n      \"pred_after = infer_with_map(df_test['before'], major_map)\",\n      \"sub = pd.DataFrame({\",\n      \"    'id': df_test['sentence_id'].astype(str) + '_' + df_test['token_id'].astype(str),\",\n      \"    'after': pred_after\",\n      \"})\",\n      \"sub.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)\",\n      \"log(f\\\"Wrote submission.csv with shape {sub.shape}\\\")\",\n      \"print(sub.head(10))\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Implement frequency lookup baseline with GroupKFold CV by sentence_id.
