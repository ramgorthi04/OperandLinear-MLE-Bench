    "llm_json": "**Planning and requesting review**\n\nI'm thinking about how to proceed with the task. First, I want to explore files, particularly the species list and sample submission, to understand the train/test mapping. I'll create a code cell to list and read text files, then show counts. Following the workflow, I should request an expert review at key checkpoints. I've already composed a plan, so it’s time to use the request_expert_review tool to get feedback on it and the strategy moving forward.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Please review the initial plan and repository layout. I intend to: (1) parse species_list.txt, rec_id2filename.txt, CVfolds_2.txt to build train/val splits; (2) start with a fast tabular baseline using supplemental_data/segment_features.txt with LightGBM/XGBoost for multi-label ROC-AUC; (3) add an image model on supplemental_data/spectrograms or filtered_spectrograms BMPs (resize, simple CNN or pretrained EfficientNet) with sigmoid BCE; (4) ensemble logits. Questions: - Confirm best-performing artifact choices here (segment_features vs filtered_spectrograms vs supervised_segmentation). - Recommended CV protocol using CVfolds_2.txt for robust AUC and avoiding leakage. - Any pitfalls with file-ID mappings (rec_id2filename) and constructing the submission format to align with sample_submission.csv? - Typical hyperparameters or tricks known to medal on MLSP 2013 (e.g., per-class calibration, class-wise weights, logit ensembling ratio). - Whether to prioritize tabular model first for a quick strong baseline and expected AUC from it alone. - Any recommended augmentations on spectrogram images that matter for this dataset. Goal: reach \\u22650.90 AUC quickly, then push for \\u22650.935 with ensemble. Provide concrete steps/settings to save time.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Overall Assessment & Strategy**\nYou have a solid plan but zero code execution with 24 hours remaining. This is a critical failure. The consensus strategy is correct: 1) Implement a fast tabular baseline, 2) build a CNN image model, 3) ensemble the results. Immediate, rapid prototyping is required.\n\n**Data Pipeline & Validation Setup (Hours 0-2)**\n*   **Critical Prerequisite:** Locate the training labels file (e.g., `rec_labels.txt` or similar). Your entire effort is blocked without it. The `rec_labels_test_hidden.txt` file is for the test set.\n*   **Train/Test Split:** Treat `CVfolds_2.txt` as the definitive train/test split (e.g., fold 1=train, fold 2=test). This is a common pattern in older competitions and the safest assumption to prevent leakage.\n*   **Validation Scheme:** Create your own robust validation scheme *within the training set only*. Use a 5-fold `GroupKFold` on `rec_id` or `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` to ensure recordings are not split across folds. This is non-negotiable for a reliable local AUC score.\n*   **Metadata:** Create a single master Pandas DataFrame indexed by `rec_id`, joining information from `rec_id2filename.txt`, your parsed labels, and your new validation fold assignments.\n\n**Phase 1: Tabular Baseline (Hours 2-6, Target AUC: ~0.90)**\n*   **Feature Choice:** For the fastest path to a strong baseline, use `histogram_of_segments.txt`. It is a pre-computed, per-recording feature set requiring no aggregation. The proven alternative is to use `segment_features.txt` and aggregate features (mean, std, max) per `rec_id`.\n*   **Model:** Use LightGBM with a One-vs-Rest approach (train one binary classifier per species).\n*   **Crucial Setting for Imbalance:** For each species-specific classifier, set `scale_pos_weight = count(negative_samples) / count(positive_samples)`. This is vital for performance.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** Start with `num_leaves=31`, `learning_rate=0.05`, `subsample=0.8`, `colsample_bytree=0.8`, `min_child_samples=20`. Use a high `n_estimators` (e.g., 5000) with early stopping on validation AUC.\n\n**Phase 2: CNN Baseline (Hours 6-14, Target AUC: ~0.92)**\n*   **Input Data:** Use `filtered_spectrograms` for their better signal-to-noise ratio. Resize to a fixed size like 224x224. For a potential boost, stack the `supervised_segmentation` mask as a second input channel.\n*   **Model:** Use a pre-trained EfficientNet-B0. Replace the head with a `Dense(num_species)` layer. Do not use a final softmax; predictions should be independent per class.\n*   **Loss & Optimizer:** Use `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`. Critically, use the `pos_weight` argument, passing it a calculated weight tensor for each class to handle imbalance. Use the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of `1e-4` to `3e-4`.\n*   **Augmentations:** The most important are SpecAugment (time and frequency masking) and random time shifts (horizontal shifts/crops). **Do not use vertical flips**, as they invert frequency and are harmful.\n\n**Phase 3: Ensembling & Submission (Hours 14-20)**\n*   **Ensemble Method:** Average the logits from your best tabular and CNN models: `final_logits = w_tab * logit_tab + w_cnn * logit_cnn`. Start with weights like `0.4` for tabular and `0.6` for CNN, then tune this ratio on your out-of-fold (OOF) validation predictions.\n*   **Calibration (Optional):** For a small gain, apply Platt scaling by fitting a Logistic Regression on your OOF logits for each class.\n*   **Submission Format:**\n    *   **Column Order:** Ensure prediction columns are ordered exactly according to `species_list.txt`.\n    *   **Row Order:** Ensure prediction rows are ordered exactly according to `sample_submission.csv`.\n    *   **ID Format:** Double-check if the submission requires a long format (e.g., `rec_id_species_id`).\n    *   **Clipping:** Clip final probabilities (e.g., to `[1e-5, 1-1e-5]`) to avoid logloss errors.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: execute a fast, CV-driven pipeline now; hit CV macro AUC ≥0.87, submit, then iterate/ensemble.\n\nStatus\n- Not on track: no code, no CV, no submission.\n\nImmediate actions (next 60–90 min)\n- Inventory data: list files; locate train labels, test ids, sample_submission.csv (species order), spectrogram BMPs or audio/features, CVfolds_2.txt, any segment_features.*.\n- Define splits/metric: parse CVfolds_2.txt; use macro ROC-AUC over species for validation; keep per-fold OOF predictions.\n- Build one quick baseline and produce submission.csv.\n\nBaseline A: CNN on spectrograms (preferred if images exist)\n- Data: load BMPs; normalize; if 1-channel, replicate to 3 for ImageNet backbones.\n- Augment: light time shift, time/freq masking; optional mixup 0.2.\n- Model: pretrained ResNet18 or EfficientNet-B0; replace head to num_classes; sigmoid outputs (use BCEWithLogitsLoss).\n- Imbalance: per-class pos_weight ≈ inverse prevalence.\n- Optim/training: AdamW lr 2e-4 wd 1e-4; batch 32–64; cosine schedule; 10–15 epochs; early stop on CV AUC; save best per fold.\n- Outputs: OOF probs per class; test logits per fold.\n\nBaseline B: Tabular on segment_features (if available or faster)\n- Aggregate per clip (mean/max/std) or use clip-level features.\n- Model: LightGBM one-vs-rest (num_leaves≈63, lr 0.05, n_estimators up to 2000 with early_stopping 100) or LogisticRegression with class_weight.\n- Use same folds; save OOF and test probs.\n\nEnsemble (after first baselines)\n- Blend OOF probs to maximize CV AUC: start p = 0.7*CNN + 0.3*Tabular; tune 0.6–0.8 range.\n- Apply same weights to test predictions; average across folds before ensembling.\n\nSubmission\n- Use sample_submission.csv for row/column order; align species exactly.\n- For each fold, predict test; average fold probs; ensemble if applicable.\n- Don’t threshold; save probabilities to submission.csv.\n\nTargets and decisions\n- Minimum viable: any CV AUC; submit to unblock iteration.\n- CNN-only CV macro AUC: aim 0.85–0.88; if <0.84, increase input size, improve aug, adjust pos_weight, try stronger backbone (ResNet50/ConvNeXt-T).\n- Ensemble CV macro AUC: ≥0.87 bronze, ≥0.90 silver.\n- Iterate: tune LGBM, stronger CNN, better aug, calibrate ensemble weights.\n\nTime plan\n- 0–1.5 h: data inventory, one baseline trained with CV, first submission.\n- 1.5–3 h: second baseline (tabular or stronger CNN), OOF saved.\n- 3–4 h: ensemble + tuned weights, second submission.\n- Remaining: regularization/aug tweaks, final submission.\n\nPitfalls to avoid\n- Species order mismatch between labels and submission.\n- Any train–test leakage (e.g., normalization fit on full data).\n- Computing AUC on thresholded outputs (use raw probs).\n- Not averaging folds; forgetting sigmoid on logits."

    "llm_json": "**Investigating labels for segments**\n\nI'm noticing that there are no train labels found, which is puzzling. But I have these files: histogram_of_segments.txt and segment_features.txt — could the labels be in the histogram file? I also suspect rec_labels_test_hidden holds hidden test labels, hinting that train labels might be absent. It seems the sample_submission file could provide insights, containing IDs and probabilities. It’s likely this competition is focusing on predicting certain pairs, so I need to clarify where the training labels are. Perhaps they should be in rec_labels.txt, but they're missing.**Exploring potential label sources**\n\nI'm considering that labels might be hidden in rec_id2filename, but that doesn't seem right. I should check essential_data/species_list.txt since it includes header lines, which need parsing correctly as a CSV. I'm also keen on examining histogram_of_segments.txt for its format for any labels. I plan to read both segment_features and histogram_of_segments into dataframes to see if they have the rec_id and labels. There might also be clues in rec_labels_test_hidden, but training labels remain elusive. I’ll check the CV folds for possible hidden labels and explore if essential_data/src_wavs has anything, though that seems unlikely.**Inspecting file contents**\n\nI need to check the content of various files to find the labels. I’ll start by adding a cell to open and print the heads of several text files: I'll ensure species_list is correctly parsed as a CSV, and I’ll look closely at histogram_of_segments.txt and segment_features.txt to confirm their delimiters. I should also check rec_labels_test_hidden for structure. It’s possible we overlooked essential_data/rec_labels.txt, but I’ll search recursively for any labels file.

    "llm_json": "**Considering label building**\n\nI need to build labels, but there's no train labels file available. The typical MLSP might provide labels elsewhere, perhaps embedded in the filename? The species_list could help map known species, and the training data might be in rec_labels_test_hidden, which has some '?' indications for test data. It seems some rec_ids show specific label indices, but since this file is named test_hidden, it might only include a subset of public records. It looks like folds indicate that some records have labels for training while others are for testing.**Clarifying label extraction**\n\nI suspect this file contains labels for all rec_ids, with '?' representing hidden test data. I'll parse it, and for lines without '?' and that are non-empty, those will be my training labels. Each line seems to follow the format \"rec_id,[labels]\", where labels are class_ids separated by commas. If a line has a blank after the comma, that indicates no labels, and an empty line likely means none. I want to build a multi-hot matrix with 20 columns, then create a master DataFrame. I’ll use fold 0 for training and fold 1 for test predictions, while evaluating within fold 0 with GroupKFold. I’m considering grouping by station ID to avoid leakage, but since we have one row per rec_id, I might have to think this through a bit more.**Implementing model training**\n\nI’m thinking about using standard StratifiedKFold for multilabel tasks, like iterstrat. If that’s not installed, I’ll default to a simple KFold. For speed, I plan to implement LightGBM with the OneVsRest strategy using the histogram of segments. I need to parse the histogram file carefully. The first line contains the header \"rec_id,[histogram of segment features].\" I can read it using pandas, skipping headers and splitting by commas. Similarly, when parsing rec_labels_test_hidden, I’ll extract rec_ids and convert the rest into a vector of zeros and ones. If only the rec_id is present, I’ll treat it as having no labels. Then, I can create a LightGBM baseline.**Setting up LightGBM**\n\nFirst, I need to import LightGBM, and if it’s not preinstalled, I might have to install it. I should check if requirements.txt includes it as part of base ML. I’ll try to import it, and if it fails, I’ll run a pip install. For cross-validation, I want to use StratifiedKFold to look at the prevalence of any positives. Since this is multilabel, I can compute the target for each class using a binary model during training. I plan to implement KFold with shuffling and a seed for proper distribution across classes. The code will include parsing files to build df_features and df_labels, then filtering for train ids where fold == 0 and labels are known.**Preparing for LightGBM setup**\n\nFor test fold 1, the labels are unknown, marked as '?'. I'm going to build a OneVsRest LightGBM model, performing 5-fold stratified CV for each class and logging the ROC-AUC metrics. I'll store the out-of-fold predictions in an array and average predictions for the test set. I need to examine the sample_submission.csv to understand how the IDs correspond to rec_ids and class indices. It appears that the IDs may be calculated as rec_id*100 + class_id. \n\nI’ll verify this math and create code to parse labels and features, setting up the train/test splits. If needed, I might quickly install LightGBM and consider a simple logistic regression baseline if time constraints arise. I'll ensure I calculate AUC metrics for each class accurately.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 3,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Build master dataframe, parse labels, features, and train a fast LightGBM OVR baseline\",\n      \"import time\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\",\n      \"\",\n      \"start = time.time()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse species list correctly (19 classes)\",\n      \"sp_csv = pd.read_csv('essential_data/species_list.txt')\",\n      \"num_classes = sp_csv.shape[0]\",\n      \"print('Num classes:', num_classes)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse folds and mapping (CSV with header)\",\n      \"cv_df = pd.read_csv('essential_data/CVfolds_2.txt')\",\n      \"rec_map = pd.read_csv('essential_data/rec_id2filename.txt')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse labels: use rec_labels_test_hidden.txt: labels available for train (fold==0), '?' for test (fold==1)\",\n      \"lab_rows = []\",\n      \"with open('essential_data/rec_labels_test_hidden.txt', 'r') as f:\",\n      \"    header = next(f, None)\",\n      \"    for line in f:\",\n      \"        line = line.strip()\",\n      \"        if not line:\",\n      \"            continue\",\n      \"        parts = [p for p in line.split(',') if p!='']\",\n      \"        rec_id = int(parts[0])\",\n      \"        labels = parts[1:] if len(parts) > 1 else []\",\n      \"        lab_rows.append((rec_id, labels))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Convert to multi-hot vector per rec_id where labels are known (no '?' tokens)\",\n      \"label_mat = {}\",\n      \"for rec_id, labels in lab_rows:\",\n      \"    if len(labels) == 0 or any(l.strip() == '?' for l in labels):\",\n      \"        continue\",\n      \"    y = np.zeros(num_classes, dtype=np.int8)\",\n      \"    for l in labels:\",\n      \"        if l.strip()=='' or l.strip()=='?':\",\n      \"            continue\",\n      \"        cid = int(l)\",\n      \"        if 0 <= cid < num_classes:\",\n      \"            y[cid] = 1\",\n      \"    label_mat[rec_id] = y\",\n      \"print('Parsed labels for rec_ids:', len(label_mat))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse histogram_of_segments.txt (comma-separated with header row)\",\n      \"hos = pd.read_csv('supplemental_data/histogram_of_segments.txt', sep=',', header=0)\",\n      \"hos.rename(columns={hos.columns[0]: 'rec_id'}, inplace=True)\",\n      \"hos['rec_id'] = hos['rec_id'].astype(int)\",\n      \"print('Histogram features shape:', hos.shape)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Merge master frame\",\n      \"master = cv_df.merge(rec_map, on='rec_id', how='left').merge(hos, on='rec_id', how='left')\",\n      \"print('Master shape:', master.shape)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Add multi-hot labels for train fold (fold==0) where available\",\n      \"Y = np.full((master.shape[0], num_classes), np.nan, dtype=float)\",\n      \"for i, rid in enumerate(master['rec_id'].values):\",\n      \"    if rid in label_mat:\",\n      \"        Y[i, :] = label_mat[rid]\",\n      \"master_labels_mask = ~np.isnan(Y).any(axis=1)\",\n      \"print('Rows with labels:', int(master_labels_mask.sum()))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Train/valid split only within fold==0 (train set);

    "llm_json": "**Troubleshooting LightGBM and CSV Parsing**\n\nI need to fix the error with `lgb.train` regarding early stopping. LightGBM should support it, but maybe this environment only has the sklearn API or an outdated version. It's safer to use `lgb.LGBMClassifier` with the appropriate fit parameters for early stopping. If I implement early stopping manually, I can set `num_boost_round` to 500. I also noticed a parsing issue with my CSV that only read two columns. I need to check the separator to ensure all columns are correctly interpreted.**Investigating CSV Parsing Issues**\n\nI’m trying to figure out why the lines after a certain point seem different. It looks like `segment_features` lines might have been concatenated into the file. The output preview shows unexpected lines like \"0,5,0.9828...,\" suggesting that `histogram_of_segments` reading might have incorrectly included `segment_features`. Our `peek` function printed both files together due to truncation. Given that our `read_csv` produced 322 rows but only two columns, I suspect that many commas are being ignored, possibly due to the header having a comma inside square brackets. This is puzzling!**Resolving CSV Parsing Challenges**\n\nI’ve been trying to figure out why my regex separator with `engine='python'` failed, expecting five fields. Using `sep=','` should provide multiple columns, yet I'm only getting two. Maybe the pandas default engine is truncating the output shape. There could also be an issue with spaces after commas or quoting characters causing misinterpretation. To investigate further, I'll inspect the first two lines. I think implementing a function to read the histogram file manually, while splitting the lines by commas and casting values, might be a good approach to ensure accurate parsing.**Planning Implementation Steps**\n\nI need to create a new cell that reads the histogram text manually. From there, I’ll build a DataFrame with `rec_id` and the features labeled as `h0` to `hN-1`. Next, I can modify cell 3 to use this new reading function or compute the histogram of segments correctly and adjust cell 3 accordingly. To optimize, I’ll replace the reading with manual parsing and switch to the sklearn API for LightGBM without early stopping. Also, I’ll ensure the species list maintains its length of 19 and check the CV folds and maps.**Implementing Modifications**\n\nI’m going to modify the manual parsing process: I’ll read the lines, skip the header, and for each non-empty line, split it by commas. If there are fewer than two parts, I’ll continue. Then I'll extract the `rec_id` and features, collecting them as floats. After that, I’ll build a NumPy array and determine a consistent length by padding shorter entries with zeros.\n\nFor the DataFrame, it will have columns for `rec_id` and features labeled `f0` to `f{n-1}`. I’ll train using `lgb.LGBMClassifier` with multiple parameters set, but I won't use early stopping to be safe, opting for 500 estimators instead. I’ll also make adjustments for `StratifiedKFold`.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 3,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Build master dataframe, parse labels, features, and train a fast LightGBM OVR baseline\",\n      \"import time\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\",\n      \"\",\n      \"start = time.time()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse species list correctly (19 classes)\",\n      \"sp_csv = pd.read_csv('essential_data/species_list.txt')\",\n      \"num_classes = sp_csv.shape[0]\",\n      \"print('Num classes:', num_classes)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse folds and mapping (CSV with header)\",\n      \"cv_df = pd.read_csv('essential_data/CVfolds_2.txt')\",\n      \"rec_map = pd.read_csv('essential_data/rec_id2filename.txt')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse labels: use rec_labels_test_hidden.txt: labels available for train (fold==0), '?' for test (fold==1)\",\n      \"lab_rows = []\",\n      \"with open('essential_data/rec_labels_test_hidden.txt', 'r') as f:\",\n      \"    header = next(f, None)\",\n      \"    for line in f:\",\n      \"        line = line.strip()\",\n      \"        if not line:\",\n      \"            continue\",\n      \"        parts = [p for p in line.split(',') if p!='']\",\n      \"        try:\",\n      \"            rec_id = int(parts[0])\",\n      \"        except Exception:\",\n      \"            continue\",\n      \"        labels = parts[1:] if len(parts) > 1 else []\",\n      \"        lab_rows.append((rec_id, labels))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Convert to multi-hot vector per rec_id where labels are known (no '?' tokens)\",\n      \"label_mat = {}\",\n      \"for rec_id, labels in lab_rows:\",\n      \"    if len(labels) == 0 or any(l.strip() == '?' for l in labels):\",\n      \"        continue\",\n      \"    y = np.zeros(num_classes, dtype=np.int8)\",\n      \"    for l in labels:\",\n      \"        if l.strip()=='' or l.strip()=='?':\",\n      \"            continue\",\n      \"        cid = int(l)\",\n      \"        if 0 <= cid < num_classes:\",\n      \"            y[cid] = 1\",\n      \"    label_mat[rec_id] = y\",\n      \"print('Parsed labels for rec_ids:', len(label_mat))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse histogram_of_segments.txt manually (robust to formatting quirks)\",\n      \"hist_rows = []\",\n      \"with open('supplemental_data/histogram_of_segments.txt', 'r') as f:\",\n      \"    header = next(f, None)  # skip header\",\n      \"    for line in f:\",\n      \"        line = line.strip()\",\n      \"        if not line:\",\n      \"            continue\",\n      \"        parts = [p for p in line.split(',') if p!='']\",\n      \"        try:\",\n      \"            rid = int(parts[0])\",\n      \"        except Exception:\",\n      \"            continue\",\n      \"        vals = []\",\n      \"        for v in parts[1:]:\",\n      \"            try:\",\n      \"                vals.append(float(v))\",\n      \"            except Exception:\",\n      \"                vals.append(0.0)\",\n      \"        hist_rows.append((rid, vals))\",\n      \"max_len = max((len(v) for _, v in hist_rows), default=0)\",\n      \"data = np.zeros((len(hist_rows), max_len), dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"rec_ids_hist = np.zeros((len(hist_rows),), dtype=int)\",\n      \"for i, (rid, vals) in enumerate(hist_rows):\",\n      \"    rec_ids_hist[i] = rid\",\n      \"    L = min(max_len, len(vals))\",\n      \"    if L > 0:\",\n      \"        data[i, :L] = np.array(vals[:L], dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"hos = pd.DataFrame(data)\",\n      \"hos.insert(0, 'rec_id', rec_ids_hist)\",\n      \"print('Histogram features shape (manual):', hos.shape)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Merge master frame\",\n      \"master = cv_df.merge(rec_map, on='rec_id', how='left').merge(hos, on='rec_id', how='left')\",\n      \"print('Master shape:', master.shape)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Add multi-hot labels for train fold (fold==0) where available\",\n      \"Y = np.full((master.shape[0], num_classes), np.nan, dtype=float)\",\n      \"for i, rid in enumerate(master['rec_id'].values):\",\n      \"    if rid in label_mat:\",\n      \"        Y[i, :] = label_mat[rid]\",\n      \"master_labels_mask = ~np.isnan(Y).any(axis=1)\",\n      \"print('Rows with labels:', int(master_labels_mask.sum()))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Train/valid split only within fold==0 (train set);

    "llm_json": "**Analyzing training data issues**\n\nI think we should definitely include rows without labels for training, which could increase our entries significantly. I’m seeing warnings from LightGBM about \"no meaningful features,\" and I wonder if that’s due to splits where all y values are zeros. Even though we used StratifiedKFold, which means there are positives, I might have set a default min_data_in_bin resulting in zero bins because all features are constant. This could be related to the many zeros in features, but LightGBM can usually handle that. If features count as zero, it might mean our parsing led to that. However, some printed examples do show non-zero values.**Addressing model training issues**\n\nI'm analyzing the shapes of my datasets: the master shape is 322, while the training set has 145 rows. LightGBM reports zero actual features used, which typically happens due to too many bins or a small dataset. I suspect the main issue is the low positive outcomes in the training set which leads to ineffective leaves. I think I should switch to LogisticRegression or LinearSVC to avoid any constraints. I can also adjust the labels parsing to include empty labels as zeros and consider using KFold for cross-validation to create a solid baseline.**Implementing new cell logic**\n\nI'm planning to implement a new cell where I’ll parse labels, treating empty strings as zeros for the label list. I'll build the training X using fold==0 while excluding lines with '?', marking those with an unknown_mask. I want to utilize OneVsRestClassifier with LogisticRegression, setting class_weight='balanced' and using either 'liblinear' or 'saga' with a high max_iter. I can't do 5-fold KFold stratification, but I could use StratifiedKFold on summed labels to create a proxy multilabel indicator. Finally, I need to ensure I'm parsing the entire rec_labels_test_hidden file properly for increased accuracy.**Modifying cell 3**\n\nI’m planning to modify cell 3 so that I'll build y for all rec_ids where fold==0 and the labels are known, including empty lists. I want to create a label_mat_default that excludes entries with '?'. \n\nNext, I'll construct X for those rec_ids and use LogisticRegression with OVR training, implementing cross-validation for out-of-fold computations and calculating per-class AUC. After that, I'll generate test predictions based on the model trained on the complete training data for each class, ensuring we set up the submission mapping correctly. Lastly, I'll make the printing more concise.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 3,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Build master dataframe, parse labels, features, and train a fast OVR logistic baseline\",\n      \"import time\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import KFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\",\n      \"from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier\",\n      \"\",\n      \"start = time.time()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse species list correctly (19 classes)\",\n      \"sp_csv = pd.read_csv('essential_data/species_list.txt')\",\n      \"num_classes = sp_csv.shape[0]\",\n      \"print('Num classes:', num_classes)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse folds and mapping (CSV with header)\",\n      \"cv_df = pd.read_csv('essential_data/CVfolds_2.txt')\",\n      \"rec_map = pd.read_csv('essential_data/rec_id2filename.txt')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Parse labels: use rec_labels_test_hidden.txt: labels available for train (fold==0), '?' for test (fold==1)\",\n      \"lab_rows = []\",\n      \"with open('essential_data/rec_labels_test_hidden.txt', 'r') as f:\",\n      \"    header = next(f, None)\",\n      \"    for line in f:\",\n      \"        line = line.strip()\",\n      \"        if not line:\",\n      \"            continue\",\n      \"        parts = [p for p in line.split(',')]\",\n      \"        parts = [p for p in parts if p is not None and p != '']\",\n      \"        try:\",\n      \"            rec_id = int(parts[0])\",\n      \"        except Exception:\",\n      \"            continue\",\n      \"        labels = parts[1:] if len(parts) > 1 else []\",\n      \"        lab_rows.append((rec_id, labels))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Convert to multi-hot vector per rec_id\",\n      \"# - If labels contain '?': unknown, skip (test only)\",\n      \"# - If labels empty: valid negative example (all zeros)\",\n      \"label_mat = {}\",\n      \"for rec_id, labels in lab_rows:\",\n      \"    if any(l.strip() == '?' for l in labels):\",\n      \"        continue  #

It looks like the sample submission has IDs like 100, 101... which suggests that the structure is based on rec_id=1 and class_id from 0 to 18. Specifically, 100 means rec_id=1 and class 0. That's a good pattern. Now, I’ll go ahead and request an expert review by providing the necessary path, notes, questions, and plans. Let's use request_expert_review.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint: We built a quick tabular baseline.

Earlier, LightGBM failed due to 'no meaningful features' on histogram features with few positives. Next plan: switch to segment_features.txt, aggregate per rec_id with summary stats (mean, std, min, max, p10/p90, count), possibly add segment count and duration-like stats if present; then train LightGBM OVR with robust params and early stopping via sklearn API, or try CatBoost. Also plan to use MultilabelStratifiedKFold (iterstrat) within fold==0 for better OOF. Questions: 1) Confirm our use of rec_labels_test_hidden as the only label source (skip '?' rows) is correct for this setup. 2) Is histogram_of_segments known to underperform vs aggregated segment_features on this challenge? 3) Recommended aggregation set for segment_features columns (which columns to exclude/include, e.g., categorical-like fields?). 4) Best LightGBM settings for this small, imbalanced dataset to avoid 'no meaningful features' (min_data_in_leaf, max_bin, min_data_in_bin, feature_fraction settings). 5) Validation: group-wise split by rec_id is trivial; any better grouping (by station prefix PCxx) to reduce leakage? 6) Expected OOF macro AUC ranges for a strong tabular-only model and whether we should proceed directly to CNN on filtered_spectrograms concurrently. 7) Submission mapping Id=rec_id*100+class_id seems consistent\\u2014please confirm.

    "outcome": "**Overall Assessment**\nYour current 0.662 macro AUC is an expected low baseline. Do not medal at this trajectory. The path to a medal score (>0.87) is clear and requires immediate, parallel execution of two tracks: a robust tabular model and a CNN.\n\n**Tabular Model (Highest Priority - Target OOF AUC: 0.87-0.92)**\n\n1.  **Features: Abandon `histogram_of_segments`.**\n    *   **Source:** Merge `segment_features.txt` and `segment_rectangles.txt` on `rec_id` and segment index.\n    *   **Engineering:** For each segment, create `duration = t_end - t_start` and `freq_span = f_end - f_start`.\n    *   **Aggregation:** Group by `rec_id`. For all numeric features (from `segment_features` and your engineered ones), compute: `mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `median`, `skew`, `p10`, `p90`. Also add a `segment_count` feature.\n\n2.  **Validation: Use `GroupKFold` on station ID.**\n    *   Extract station ID from filenames (e.g., 'PC01'). Use this for groups in a 5-fold `GroupKFold` within your `fold==0` training data. This prevents site-specific data leakage and is more robust than `MultilabelStratifiedKFold`.\n\n3.  **Model: Switch to One-vs-Rest (OVR) LightGBM.**\n    *   **Imbalance (Critical):** For each class in the OVR loop, calculate `scale_pos_weight = n_negatives / n_positives` on the training fold data and pass it to the model parameters. This will fix the extremely low AUCs on rare classes (e.g., class 16).\n    *   **Parameters (Starter Set):**\n        *   `objective: 'binary'`, `metric: 'auc'`\n        *   `learning_rate: 0.03`, `num_leaves: 31`\n        *   `n_estimators: 2000` with `early_stopping_rounds: 100`\n        *   `feature_fraction: 0.8`, `bagging_fraction: 0.8`\n        *   **`min_child_samples: 5`** (or `min_data_in_leaf`) and **`min_data_in_bin: 1`** to prevent \"no meaningful features\" errors on sparse data.\n    *   CatBoost is a robust alternative if LightGBM proves difficult.\n\n**CNN Model (Start in Parallel - Target OOF AUC: 0.90-0.94)**\n\n1.  **Architecture:** Use a pre-trained EfficientNet-B0.\n2.  **Input:** `filtered_spectrograms`, loaded as grayscale and resized to 224x224.\n3.  **Training:**\n    *   **Loss:** `BCEWithLogitsLoss`.\n    *   **Imbalance:** Use the `pos_weight` argument in the loss function, calculated per class.\n    *   **Augmentation:** Use `SpecAugment` and horizontal shifts. **Do not use vertical flips.**\n4.  **Process:** Train for 50+ epochs with a learning rate scheduler and early stopping on validation AUC.\n\n**Ensembling & Submission**\n\n*   **Method:** Combine the tabular and CNN models by averaging their logits (not probabilities).\n*   **Weights:** Start with a 0.4 (tabular) / 0.6 (CNN) weight split and tune on your OOF predictions.\n*   **Format:** Your submission ID format (`Id = rec_id*100 + class_id`) is correct.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Raise AUC-ROC from 0.8341 to ≥0.8737 by moving beyond histogram+logreg to a spectrogram CNN + enriched tabular GBDT ensemble, with proper CV, class imbalance handling, and clean parsing.\n\nConcise plan (priority order)\n1) Build strong tabular features and model (fastest lift)\n- Parse and aggregate:\n  - segment_features.txt: per rec_id compute mean, std, min, max, p25, p50, p75, count for each numeric column; also number of segments.\n  - histogram_of_segments.txt: keep existing 100D histogram.\n  - segment_rectangles.txt: add counts and stats of width/height/time span/freq span.\n- Modeling: LightGBM/XGBoost OVR, class_weight=balanced, 5-fold internal CV on fold==0 data.\n  - Key params to try: num_leaves 31–63, max_depth -1, learning_rate 0.03–0.1, min_data_in_leaf 20–60, feature_fraction 0.7–0.95, bagging_fraction 0.7–0.95, lambda_l2 1–5.\n- Expected gain: +0.03 to +0.06 AUC over current baseline.\n\n2) Add a spectrogram CNN (largest single boost per effort)\n- Data: Use filtered_spectrograms/*.bmp mapped via rec_id2filename; load as 3-channel; resize ~224; normalize ImageNet stats.\n- Augmentations: time/freq shifts, SpecAugment (time/freq masks), light noise.\n- Model: pretrained ResNet18/EfficientNet-B0; replace head with num_classes sigmoid (BCEWithLogitsLoss); 10–20 epochs, Adam lr≈1e-4, early stopping.\n- CV: Train on fold==0 with internal splits to produce OOF; predict fold==1 test.\n- Expected gain: +0.02 to +0.05 AUC.\n\n3) Ensemble and calibrate\n- Blend CNN and GBDT probabilities/logits (start 0.5/0.5; tune weight on OOF to maximize macro AUC). Consider multiple CNN seeds/augs for averaging.\n- Expected gain: +0.01 to +0.02 AUC, pushing into bronze/silver.\n\nImplementation notes\n- Parsing: These files are comma-separated with a single header; use pandas.read_csv(..., skiprows=1) or manual split by ',' (avoid regex separators). Continue excluding “?” labels; treat blank lines as all-zero negatives.\n- Imbalance: use class weights or focal loss (CNN). Keep probability clipping minimal (e.g., [1e-6, 1-1e-6]).\n- Validation: Report OOF macro AUC on fold==0; use CVfolds_2.txt consistently. Track runs and params.\n- Submission: Keep Id = rec_id*100 + class_id; shape 64 test rec_ids × 19 classes.\n\nTarget milestones\n- GBDT on enriched tabular: 0.86–0.88\n- CNN alone: 0.85–0.88\n- Ensemble: ≥0.87 (bronze) and likely ≥0.90 (silver)\n\nDo next (in order)\n1) Implement robust parsers; build per-rec feature matrix; train LightGBM OVR with CV and submit.\n2) Train a small pretrained CNN on filtered spectrograms with SpecAugment; get OOF and test preds.\n3) Blend GBDT+CNN, tune weights on OOF; resubmit."

Plus, I can add pre-computed feature counts and group distributions in the logs for better clarity.**Adjusting LightGBM parameters**\n\nThe 'verbose' parameter for the fit method in LGBMClassifier is only accepted in some versions, so it’s safer to avoid it altogether. Instead, I’ll use callbacks for early stopping and logging evaluation, but I need to confirm that I've imported LightGBM as 'lgb'. I already did that, so I'm in good shape. I'll remove the early_stopping_rounds argument and utilize the callbacks. Also, reducing aggregation to fewer statistics could help with feature dimensionality. Once that’s done, I can re-execute cell 4.**Implementing modifications**\n\nI’m ready to add some modifications. First, I’ll print the number of features and the unique groups after building X. In the parameters, I’ll set n_estimators to 600 and the learning rate to 0.05. When fitting the model, I’ll include the eval_set, use 'auc' for the eval_metric, and add the early stopping and log evaluation callbacks.

    "llm_json": "**Setting up PyTorch training**\n\nI’m adding a new cell for setting up PyTorch training on filtered spectrograms. This involves defining the dataset, transforms, and using the EfficientNet-B0 model with a training loop that incorporates GroupKFold on the station. I need to ensure that we create out-of-fold and test predictions, saving them as npy files. Since the environment doesn’t have PyTorch installed, I'll start by inserting a code cell to install the necessary packages before proceeding with the training loop.**Installing necessary packages**\n\nI’ll start with the command to install specific versions of PyTorch and related packages, including `torch==2.4.0`, `torchvision==0.19.0`, and `torchaudio==2.4.0`, along with `timm==0.9.16`, `albumentations`, `scikit-image`, and `opencv-python-headless`. After that, I can execute the cell. To keep everything organized, I plan to add a new cell at index 5 for installation and seed setting. I’ll use the `edit_notebook` function to insert this cell and prepare basic dataset reading stubs.**Crafting the training code**\n\nI’ll be writing some code that first installs necessary packages using subprocess in a Python cell to avoid shell usage. I need to define a function that maps record IDs to their respective image file paths from the `rec_map` and `filtered_spectrograms` directory, ensuring filenames match without extensions. I'll also build the labels as before and create a DataFrame for the training fold with necessary filtering.\n\nNext, I’ll implement GroupKFold splits by station. I will define a PyTorch Dataset class to load bmps, converting images to grayscale, resizing to 224x224, and normalizing them for ImageNet. Adding SpecAugment techniques will enhance randomness for the images through techniques like horizontal shifts and time/frequency masking.\n\nFor the model, I’ll use timm to create an EfficientNet-B0 model, setting it up with pre-training and a specified loss function.**Setting up the training process**\n\nI’m planning to use the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 3e-4. I’ll focus on training for shorter epochs, around 12, using early stopping with a patience of 3 to optimize speed. I also intend to implement mixed precision autocasting for efficiency.\n\nAs for outputs, I’ll save the out-of-fold and test prediction probabilities as `oof.npy` and `test_pred.npy`, which is a bit extensive.

    "llm_json": "**Resolving kernel issues**\n\nI need to address the kernel dying while executing cell 6. It seems the problem might stem from conflicting torch versions, likely causing a segmentation fault. My logs show that torch 2.8.0 is installed, but we're trying to use torch==2.4.0 and facing dependency complaints with torchaudio. To avoid crashes, I could run the CNN on CPU or adjust torch settings. For our project, I must aim for a higher OOF score than 0.83410, ideally over 0.93 for gold. We've got to finish executing cell 4 to complete the task.**Fixing the CNN cell**\n\nI need to focus on getting CNN cell 6 to run on the CPU to prevent kernel crashes. We'll execute it quickly using fewer epochs and a smaller model like resnet18. Since the kernel dies, it could be due to CUDA libraries when importing torch.\n\nTo fix it, I’ll set the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to an empty string before importing torch. I’ll also adjust cell 6 to specify device='cpu' and remove the amp settings. Let's modify the header accordingly!**Modifying cell 6 code**\n\nI’ll modify cell 6 by adding a line at the top to import `os` and set `os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES']=''` before importing torch. Then, I’ll set the device to `torch.device('cpu')` and disable the GradScaler and autocast by setting both to false.\n\nTo speed things up, I can reduce the epochs to, say, 8, and I need to confirm whether to build the model with pretrained weights. Since using pretrained weights requires internet access, I’ll keep `pretrained=True`. Hopefully, these changes will resolve the kernel issues!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 6,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# CNN baseline: EfficientNet-B0 on filtered spectrograms with GroupKFold by station (force CPU to avoid CUDA issues)\",\n      \"import os, glob, time, math, random, gc\",\n      \"os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = ''  # disable CUDA to prevent kernel crashes from CUDA/cuDNN mismatch\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"import cv2\",\n      \"import torch\",\n      \"import torch.nn as nn\",\n      \"import torch.nn.functional as F\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"import timm\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def seed_everything(seed=42):\",\n      \"    random.seed(seed);

If nothing shows, the execution status could be wrong. I think I should try running it for training, even though it might take a while on CPU. Let's execute cell 6 now and monitor as it trains.**Executing notebook cell**\n\nI need to use the command to execute notebook code at cell index 6. After that, it might be good to wait around 5 minutes, since the tool operates in the background. I could still use the next turns while it runs, so that’s a positive.

    "llm_json": "**Troubleshooting kernel issues**\n\nI'm facing a kernel crash when executing cell 6, probably because the versions of timm and torch I'm using are mismatched. It dies on import, even with CPU enforcement, so I'll need to avoid the torch pipeline for now. I want to focus on improving the tabular model since we had a strong score of 0.8341 in cell 4, but the current output seems truncated; I'm not sure if it computed the macro AUC correctly. For now, I'll work on enhancements and explore models like CatBoost and XGBoost.**Optimizing model performance**\n\nI'm considering tuning the LightGBM parameters and possibly adding monotonic constraints. Another idea is to train a per-class logistic regression on aggregated features and stack it with LightGBM using linear blending for optimal weights. We want to reach a bronze medal threshold of 0.87372 OOF, since our current score of 0.8341 isn't enough. I aim to implement a second model using XGBoost or ExtraTrees. I'll create a new cell 7 to rebuild the engineered features, using previous functions or saved variables, then train different models for better performance.**Blending and optimizing predictions**\n\nI’m planning to blend the out-of-fold (OOF) predictions to maximize the macro AUC. I need to find a weight \\( w \\) in the range [0,1] that optimally mixes LightGBM and logistic regression outputs. I’ll begin with a single global weight grid, applying the same weights to test predictions when creating the submission file. It's important to save the OOF and test arrays too. I want to implement this in a new cell, focusing on concise logging and using StandardScaler and balanced class weights. I'll also plan to seek expert review once we hit a milestone.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 7,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Tabular ensembling: add OVR Logistic on aggregated features and blend with LightGBM using OOF AUC tuning\",\n      \"import numpy as np, pandas as pd, time, sys, glob, re\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\",\n      \"from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\",\n      \"from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"\",\n      \"t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"# 1) Load metadata and aggregated features (repeat logic from cell 4 to be self-contained)\",\n      \"sp_df = pd.read_csv('essential_data/species_list.txt');

    "llm_json": "**Addressing Logistic Regression Errors**\n\nI need to fix an error in cell 7 where Logistic Regression fails when there's only one class in the training fold. The issue arises when all labels are zeros. I think we can either skip such folds or adjust the class weight and solver. Logistic Regression requires two classes to function correctly.\n\nIf the unique count of y_tr is less than 2, I could fit a trivial predictor by setting the probability to the mean of y. In instances with no positives, predicting 0.0 makes sense, and for no negatives, predicting 1.0 could work too. I should implement a condition to assign constant probabilities based on the global prevalence.**Modifying Prediction Logic**\n\nI need to set predictions for validation and test sets while skipping fitting in that fold. I’ll modify cell 7 to properly wrap the training loop. Using the logistic solver \"liblinear\" seems fine, and I might consider adding regularization later, but for now, I’ll leave it as is.\n\nI want to implement logging per class minimally. In the inner loop, if there are fewer than two unique values in y_tr, I can set a constant probability based on the mean across the entire training set. I need to add a similar guard for LightGBM, ensuring it also assigns constant probabilities if there are no positives or negatives.

Any specific splits or station-based leakage pitfalls to guard against? \\n3) Modeling: Per-class tuned LGBM hyperparameters, alternative learners (CatBoost with class weights, XGBoost with AUC-PR proxy), or calibrated stacking (e.g., ridge/logit meta-learner on OOF). Recommended defaults? \\n4) Incorporating histogram_of_segments.txt: earlier tests with raw histograms underperformed. Should we concatenate hist bins to the aggregated features, or re-bin/normalize differently? \\n5) Handling extreme class imbalance (many classes have 5\\u201310 positives in fold 0): beyond scale_pos_weight, any tricks (bagging, stratified bootstraps, focal-like objective via LightGBM parameters) that are known to help for AUC on tiny positives? \\n6) Any known winning tricks for this competition given the exact dataset artifacts? \\n\\nConstraints: 24h runtime, CPU/GPU available but PyTorch stack is unstable in this environment.

    "outcome": "**Synthesized Assessment & Action Plan**\n\n**Overall:**\nYour 0.834 AUC is a strong baseline but insufficient for a medal (target ≥0.874). The CNN path is blocked; focus entirely on the tabular model. The recent Logistic Regression blend was ineffective and should be discarded. The path to a medal is through aggressive feature engineering and robust ensembling.\n\n**1. Feature Engineering (Highest Priority)**\nThis is where the largest gains (~0.04+ AUC) will come from. Create a single, reusable feature generation function.\n\n*   **Restore Baseline:** Re-add `'skew'` to your aggregations.\n*   **Add Core Aggregations & Ratios:**\n    *   **Nonzero Counts:** For each feature, add `nonzero_count` and `nonzero_ratio` (count/total segments).\n    *   **Log Transforms:** For skewed features (duration, energy), add `log1p()` of their stats (mean, std).\n    *   **Duration/Frequency Stats:** Add `skew`, `iqr`, and interaction features like `duration_mean * freq_span_mean`.\n    *   **Coverage & Density:** Add `total_duration / rec_duration`, `total_freq_span / rec_freq_span`, and `segment_count / rec_duration`.\n*   **Add Advanced Features:**\n    *   **Top-K Pooling:** For each recording, sort segments by energy or duration and aggregate the top 1, 3, and 5 segments (e.g., `top3_duration_mean`).\n    *   **Time/Frequency Binning:** Divide each recording's time and frequency ranges into 5-10 bins. Add features for the count/fraction of segments in each bin.\n    *   **Station Priors:** Create leakage-safe target encodings by computing the mean target value per station *within each training fold*. This is a known high-impact feature for this dataset.\n*   **Incorporate Histogram Features:**\n    *   Do not concatenate raw histogram features.\n    *   **Method:** On each training fold, L1-normalize the histogram rows, then fit and apply a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA or TruncatedSVD (e.g., 16-32 components). Concatenate these components to your main feature set.\n*   **Improve Missingness Handling:**\n    *   For recordings with no segments, do not `fillna(0)`. Let LightGBM/CatBoost handle NaNs natively and add a `has_segments` (1/0) indicator feature.\n\n**2. Modeling & Ensembling**\nBuild an ensemble of two strong, diverse models.\n\n*   **Model 1: Optimized LightGBM:**\n    *   Increase power: `n_estimators=2000-5000` with `early_stopping_rounds=100-200`.\n    *   Use `scale_pos_weight` for imbalance.\n    *   For stability, train 3 models with different random seeds and average their rank predictions.\n*   **Model 2: CatBoost:**\n    *   Implement a similar per-class loop using `CatBoostClassifier`.\n    *   Use `iterations=2000-3000`, `early_stopping_rounds=100-200`, and `auto_class_weights='Balanced'`.\n    *   CatBoost's robustness and different tree-building algorithm provide excellent diversity.\n*   **Ensembling Method:**\n    *   **Stacking (Recommended):** Train a meta-learner (e.g., `RidgeClassifier` or `LogisticRegression`) on the out-of-fold (OOF) predictions from your base models (LGBM, CatBoost).\n    *   **Blending (Simpler Alternative):** Find the optimal per-class blend weight `w` that maximizes the AUC of `w * oof_lgb + (1-w) * oof_cb`.\n\n**3. Validation Scheme**\nYour `GroupKFold` by `station` is correct. Refine it for stability.\n\n*   To handle rare classes, generate multiple random seeds for the `GroupKFold` split. Select the split that maximizes the minimum number of positive samples for each class across all folds.\n*   Within each fold, drop columns with zero variance before training.\n\n**4. Handling Extreme Imbalance**\nFor classes with very few positives (<20):\n\n*   `scale_pos_weight` (LGBM) and `auto_class_weights` (CatBoost) are the first line of defense.\n*   **Bagging (Advanced):** For the rarest classes, train multiple small models on bootstrapped samples (e.g., keeping all positives while sampling from negatives) and average their predictions. `BalancedBaggingClassifier` is a good implementation.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Close but not yet on track (LB 0.779 << bronze 0.87372). Your tabular OOF ~0.834 is promising; CNN isn’t producing outputs; class imbalance and missing features hurt generalization. Execute CNN, fix tabular coverage, and ensemble via OOF-optimized weights.\n\nDo this next (priority order):\n- Run/fix CNN now\n  - Ensure it trains and saves OOF/test preds; debug silent failure.\n  - If possible enable GPU; else CPU is fine with small models.\n  - Settings: 5-fold GroupKFold by station; 15–25 epochs with early stopping (patience 3–4); cosine LR; weight decay 1e-4; BCEWithLogitsLoss with pos_weight; ImageNet normalization.\n  - Augmentations: SpecAugment (time/freq masks), time/freq shifts, light brightness/contrast, small Gaussian noise.\n  - Backbones/image size: efficientnet_b0/b1 at 256–320 px on CPU; if resources allow, b3 or convnext_tiny at 320–384.\n  - If slow, start with 12–15 epochs; ensure every fold writes cnn_oof.npy and cnn_test_pred.npy.\n\n- Ensemble properly\n  - Blend CNN with best tabular using OOF to pick weights (optionally per-class weights or ridge stacking).\n  - Keep each submission tied to its OOF AUC; don’t overwrite a stronger single model with a weaker blend.\n  - Submit the blend after verifying OOF gain (+0.02–0.05 AUC expected).\n\n- Fix tabular pipeline and coverage\n  - Ensure every rec_id has meaningful features: add histogram_of_segments as fallback, counts (num_segments), duration stats, and any simple aggregates so zero-filled rows disappear.\n  - LightGBM: more trees (n_estimators 1500–3000) with early stopping; scale_pos_weight; tune num_leaves/min_data_in_leaf/reg_lambda to stop “no positive gain” splits.\n  - Try XGBoost/CatBoost as alternatives if LGBM remains unstable.\n  - Recompute OOF with same GroupKFold splits used by CNN.\n\n- Handle class imbalance\n  - Keep pos_weight in both tabular (scale_pos_weight) and CNN loss.\n  - Optionally oversample minority positives within each training fold (avoid leakage with GroupKFold); consider focal loss for CNN.\n\n- Validation and data hygiene\n  - Use consistent GroupKFold by station for all models; no leakage from test or other folds.\n  - Confirm label parsing keeps all-negative rows.\n  - Investigate LB–OOF gap; add regularization if OOF >> LB.\n\n- Submission discipline\n  - Submit your strongest current single model (improved LGBM) while CNN trains.\n  - After CNN, submit the OOF-optimized blend. Track LB vs OOF each step.\n\nExpected outcome\n- Improved tabular: ~0.82–0.86 OOF.\n- CNN on spectrograms: ~0.85–0.90 OOF.\n- Blend: likely ≥0.87 LB (bronze), with upside toward silver if training/ensembling is solid.\n\nConcise, actionable summary:\n1) Get CNN training to completion with robust aug, early stopping, and pos_weight; save OOF/test preds. \n2) Ensure tabular features cover all recordings; re-train LGBM (more trees, regularization). \n3) Blend CNN + tabular via OOF-weight search or ridge stacking; submit strongest single model and then the blend. \n4) Keep strict GroupKFold-by-station validation, handle imbalance, and monitor OOF→LB correlation."

    "llm_json": "**Planning feature engineering**\n\nI’m considering the next steps for our feature engineering based on expert advice to focus on tabular features. Currently, our cell implementation does simple aggregations, but the logistic model isn't performing well. The training logs suggest we have degenerate features since NaNs are filled with zeros, leading to many constant columns. I’ll explore improved techniques like adding skew, nonzero counts, and various statistical features, along with using TruncatedSVD to refine our data further.**Setting up stronger modeling**\n\nI'm planning to implement a new cell that builds a function for feature engineering and trains a more robust LGBM model with 2000 estimators and early stopping. I’ll also consider bagging with three seeds to average ranks and drop zero-variance columns to enhance our model's performance. Additionally, I need to set up a feature builder and use LightGBM's One-Versus-Rest (OVR) approach with GroupKFold, along with logging for tracking progress. Finally, I’ll save the submission.**Creating new feature cell**\n\nI’m setting up cell 8 to merge features and rectangles for a comprehensive view. I’ll compute additional per-segment columns like duration and freq_span, then add area by multiplying them, which seems safe. I'll aggregate recordings with functions like mean, standard deviation, and skew. For numerical columns, I'll calculate nonzero counts and ratios using groupby. I plan to implement log1p transforms for specific columns and top-K pooling based on duration or area, while keeping dimensions manageable. Lastly, I’ll record duration and frequency span from rectangles.**Assigning segment bins and features**\n\nNext, I'll assign each segment a bin index for better segmentation, creating count features normalized by the total segments. For station prior target encoding, I'll calculate per-station prevalence using training fold data and merge this into features during cross-validation. For test predictions, I’ll derive from all training data, which means implementing station priors in the per-class CV loop. I'm also planning histogram processing, including L1-normalization and applying TruncatedSVD. We might not complete everything, but I'll start with adding skew, nonzero counts, and keep features efficient for LightGBM.**Enhancing feature engineering and training**\n\nI’m ready to implement improvements in cell 8 by focusing on feature engineering and training an LGBM model with 2000 estimators using early stopping and GroupKFold. I'll drop zero-variance columns and allow NaNs since LightGBM can handle them. It looks like we’ve got some issues with missing segments affecting our aggregated rows; thus, I need to ensure we capture features for those rec_ids with no segments. \n\nI’ll process the histogram data through TruncatedSVD for the train records, while integrating station prior features.

    "llm_json": "**Diagnosing poor OOF scores**\n\nI need to determine the next steps since our current out-of-fold (OOF) scores are poor. The earlier \"strong\" cell 4 gave a score of 0.83410, but the recent rerun is showing strange LightGBM logs, including \"valid_0's auc: 1\" and best_iter=1. This suggests possible target leakage. \n\nAlso, in cell 1, the initial parsing of species_list mistakenly included the header row. Although later runs used pd.read_csv correctly with 19 classes, I’m confused about why the current OOF scores are poor. In cell 11, tab_lgb_oof from cell 7, recomputed with features filled with zeroes, got a score of 0.4878. Maybe the scoring changed due to labeling misalignment or including the fold column among the features.**Implementing evaluation enhancements**\n\nIn cell 4, OOF and macro metrics were calculated, but it seems the final results were truncated and not printed out. I need to compute the macro from the saved tab_strong_oof.npy. \n\nI’ll add an evaluator similar to the one used in cell 9, focusing on tab_strong_oof.npy and utilizing lgbv2 if it exists. After that, I'll create a submission using tab_strong_test.npy. \n\nThis calls for a new cell 12 to compute AUCs for all saved arrays and print the results. The performance is at 82%, which is acceptable. I’ll make sure to include tab_strong in the evaluations and proceed with implementing these changes.

I want to wrap the training in try/except to save partial results. However, modifying the notebook means I need to do it carefully before executing. Since the last run took a long time and didn’t save, it's essential to handle exceptions properly. I’ll consider adjusting Cell 4, adding log suppression for evaluation and saving intermediate results after each class loop.**Modifying notebook cells**\n\nI realize I need to specify exact lines to edit an existing cell, but I can replace the whole cell using an edit_notebook function. I want to keep most of the code while adding try/except around per-class training and ensuring results are saved after each class. I’ll add time logging and flush, while removing some logging to keep it concise. Although LightGBM requires an eval_set, I’ll skip using it for degenerate y_va cases and proceed to modify Cell 4 as planned.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 4,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Strong tabular model: aggregate segment_features + rectangles, GroupKFold by station, OVR LightGBM (robust + periodic saves)\",\n      \"import numpy as np, pandas as pd, time, re, glob, sys, os\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold\",\n      \"\",\n      \"t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# 1) Load core metadata\",\n      \"sp_df = pd.read_csv('essential_data/species_list.txt')\",\n      \"num_classes = sp_df.shape[0]\",\n      \"cv_df = pd.read_csv('essential_data/CVfolds_2.txt')\",\n      \"rec_map = pd.read_csv('essential_data/rec_id2filename.txt')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# station group from filename prefix before first '_'\",\n      \"rec_map['station'] = rec_map['filename'].str.split('_').str[0]\",\n      \"meta = cv_df.merge(rec_map, on='rec_id', how='left')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# 2) Parse labels (skip '?' lines;

    "llm_json": "**Addressing alignment issues**\n\nI'm considering potential differences in the order of rows between merged datasets. It seems the saved out-of-fold shape should match the training label shape, but the low AUC suggests a mismatch in the order of rows. To resolve this, I should save the `rec_train_ids` order alongside the OOF and use it for label alignment when calculating AUC. Also, I need to ensure that test predictions align with the order in `rec_test`. Lastly, I'll modify Cell 4 to save both `rec_train_ids` and `rec_test_ids`.**Adjusting evaluation processes**\n\nI’m planning to adjust Cell 12 to utilize corresponding IDs, like `tab_strong_train_ids.npy`, for building labels and mappings when evaluating candidates. If those IDs don’t exist, I'll fallback to the previous method. For models like `advtab` and `tab_lgb`, since they didn’t save IDs, I assume they used the same ordering. To be cautious, I’ll apply special alignment for `tab_strong`. \n\nI might need to run Cell 4 to ensure proper file saving, but first, I'll modify Cell 12 to recompute the AUC using the IDs while also preparing submission files accordingly.**Assessing mapping issues**\n\nI’m considering whether the wrong mapping could be causing the 0.49 AUC issue. Fixing this without rerunning is tricky. My plan is to modify Cell 4 to save IDs and then fully rerun it to regenerate the correct predictions, though that will take some time. \n\nAt this milestone, I think it’s a good moment to request an expert review for advice on leakage, proper cross-validation (CV), and feature scaling. I could ask about the drop in performance, alignment fixes, parameter choices, and whether to use stratified KFold for this multi-label, group-based issue.**Requesting expert review**\n\nI’m planning to use `request_expert_review` on `main.ipynb` to address a drop in performance from a strong model that scored 0.834 to now 0.49. I suspect this is due to a label or OOF alignment mismatch. My proposal includes saving record IDs for proper alignment. I’ll also ask if using early stopping with evaluation on the same fold is acceptable, and whether GroupKFold should be applied by station to ensure group distribution. Additionally, I’m curious about quick improvements, like segment pooling rather than heavy aggregation, and using station priors to calibrate thresholds. Should we abandon the tabular approach for a linear model on histograms? Lastly, I'd like to know if top solutions utilized simple features. I'll proceed with the request.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint: Our strongest prior run of the tabular aggregation model (Cell 4, segment_features + rectangles, GroupKFold by station, LGBM OVR) achieved ~0.8341 OOF Macro AUC, but current re-runs produce ~0.49 and selection favors a much weaker 0.5268 model. Suspicions: (1) OOF/label misalignment between saved oof arrays and labels reconstructed in Cell 12; (2) test_pred alignment mismatch when building submission; (3) potential leakage in the earlier high score (logs showed auc=1, best_iter=1). Actions taken: hardened Cell 4 to periodically save npy files and added guards for degenerate folds; it now saves tab_strong_oof.npy/test.npy, but without rec_id order metadata. Questions: 1) What is the best-practice to ensure strict alignment for multi-label OOF across multiple notebooks? Should we always save rec_train_ids.npy and rec_test_ids.npy alongside predictions, and then evaluate using those exact ids? 2) Is our GroupKFold by station correct for this dataset (stations: PC1...PC18)? Any grouping pitfalls to avoid leakage with these features? 3) The LightGBM warnings 'No further splits with positive gain' and auc=1 with best_iter=1 in earlier logs\\u2014do these indicate a bug/leak in features or validation (e.g., unintended inclusion of target-like columns)? 4) Given our logistic baseline on histograms is ~0.662 OOF but our aggregated segment features LGBM is ~0.49, what specific feature construction from segment_features/rectangles tends to work best historically for this competition (e.g., per-segment top-k, time/freq coverage ratios, station priors)? 5) What minimal, fast changes can push us to \\u22650.87 OOF to medal under time constraints without CNNs (PyTorch path is unstable)? Proposed plan post-advice: (a) Modify Cell 4 to also save train/test rec_id orders and re-run fully; (b) Modify Cell 12 to evaluate using per-model ids if present; (c) Re-try LGBM with tuned params and verified alignment; (d) If still weak, pivot to a strong linear model on histogram + a few station/time features and ensemble. Please advise prioritization and any pitfalls to avoid.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Overall Diagnosis**\n\nThe score drop from 0.8341 to ~0.50 is caused by a critical **OOF/label misalignment bug**. Your saved OOF predictions are not in the same order as the labels you reconstruct for evaluation, causing the score to collapse to near-random. The previous 0.8341 score was invalid, inflated by a **data leak** proven by `auc=1` and `best_iter=1` logs. Do not chase that score; your true baseline is likely ~0.75-0.84 once the alignment bug is fixed.\n\n**Immediate Action Plan to Reach ≥0.87**\n\n**Phase 1: Stabilize Pipeline & Fix Alignment (Highest Priority)**\n1.  **Implement Strict Alignment Protocol:** This is non-negotiable.\n    *   When training and saving predictions, also save the corresponding record ID order: `np.save('model_rec_train_ids.npy', rec_train)` and `np.save('model_rec_test_ids.npy', rec_test)`.\n    *   In your evaluation cell, load these specific ID files. Use them to create an index map to reorder your ground truth labels (`Y_train`) to perfectly match the OOF prediction order before calculating AUC. Refuse to evaluate any model files that lack corresponding ID files.\n2.  **Handle Degenerate Folds:** The `auc=1` warnings are also caused by validation folds with only one class (all 0s or all 1s).\n    *   **Guard:** Before training on a fold, check if `y_val` has fewer than two unique classes. If so, skip fitting and use a constant prediction (e.g., `y_train.mean()`).\n    *   **Improve Folds (Optional but Recommended):** To prevent this, run `GroupKFold` multiple times with different shuffles and select the split that maximizes the minimum number of positive samples across all folds.\n\n**Phase 2: Add High-Impact Features**\n1.  **Leakage-Safe Station Priors:** Inside each fold's training loop, calculate the mean target rate per station using *only that fold's training data*. Add this as a feature to the validation and test sets for that fold.\n2.  **Coverage & Density Features:** Add simple, powerful aggregations:\n    *   `segment_count`\n    *   `segment_density` (e.g., `segment_count / recording_duration`)\n    *   `time_coverage_ratio` (e.g., `sum_of_segment_durations / recording_duration`)\n3.  **Advanced Aggregations & SVD:**\n    *   Add `skew`, `kurtosis`, and quantiles (`q10`, `q90`) to your existing aggregations.\n    *   Implement Top-k pooling: for the most important features, aggregate the top 3-5 segments sorted by energy or duration.\n    *   Add SVD on histogram features (16 components per fold).\n\n**Phase 3: Finalize Model & Submission**\n1.  **Tune Hyperparameters:** Use a stronger LightGBM configuration: `n_estimators=3000`, `early_stopping_rounds=150`, `num_leaves=63`, `learning_rate=0.02`, `reg_lambda=1.0`, `min_child_samples=10`.\n2.  **Seed Averaging:** This is critical for stability and a score boost. Run your entire training process 3 times with different random seeds. Average the resulting OOF and test predictions to create your final submission.\n3.  **Ensemble (Optional):** If time permits, train a CatBoost model with similar features and blend its predictions with your averaged LightGBM model for a final small gain.\n\n**Summary of Key Questions**\n*   **OOF Alignment:** Yes, your suspicion was correct. Always save and use `rec_id` arrays to ensure alignment.\n*   **GroupKFold by Station:** This is the correct and robust approach to prevent geographic leakage.\n*   **LGBM Warnings:** `auc=1` indicates a data leak or a degenerate (single-class) validation fold. \"No further splits\" points to uninformative features or very few positive samples.\n*   **Best Features:** Your core aggregations are a good start. The highest-impact additions are leakage-safe station priors, coverage/density ratios, and seed averaging.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: recover the strong tabular pipeline, validate correctly, then push AUC via multi-seed ensembling and selective model/feature upgrades; avoid weak blends and leakage.\n\nStatus and target\n- Not on track: LB 0.79674 vs bronze ≥ 0.87372; gap ~0.08–0.14.\n- Best proven OOF: ~0.834 (original Cell 4). Current selection uses a weak model (advtab OOF 0.5268).\n\nImmediate priorities (in order)\n1. Recover Cell 4 strong tabular and save preds\n   - Restart kernel; run Cell 4 cleanly end-to-end.\n   - Features: segment_features + segment_rectangles aggregations; fillna(0).\n   - CV: GroupKFold by station on fold==0; no leakage from fold==1.\n   - LightGBM: learning_rate 0.05; num_leaves 31; n_estimators 800–1200 with early_stopping(50–100); subsample/colsample 0.8; min_child_samples 5–10; reg_lambda 1–2; scale_pos_weight=neg/pos per fold; set random_state.\n   - Save tab_strong_oof.npy and tab_strong_test.npy immediately.\n2. Fix evaluation/selection (Cell 12)\n   - Evaluate all saved OOF arrays; choose highest AUC.\n   - Ensure tab_strong is selected; write submission.csv; verify no NaNs and columns match sample.\n3. Stabilize and lift with seeds\n   - Train 3 distinct seeds of the same setup; average logits/probs; re-evaluate OOF; submit best.\n\nGuardrails (prevent past failures)\n- Watch for suspicious valid AUC=1 or best_iter=1 → leakage/mis-splits; recheck grouping and label parsing (keep empty-label rows as all-zero).\n- Handle degenerate folds (no positives): skip or backfill with global mean; don’t save corrupted OOF.\n- Do not blend with weak models (advtab, raw hist). They drag AUC down.\n\nIf time allows: push above bronze\n- Feature engineering\n  - Station priors (mean label per station), time-of-day from filename, simple interactions (e.g., duration_mean × freq_span_mean).\n  - Compact histogram info via TruncatedSVD (10–20 comps) rather than raw bins.\n  - Optional audio features (MFCCs, spectral centroid, ZCR) if extraction is fast.\n- Model diversification\n  - Try XGBoost/CatBoost with same CV; tune learning_rate, depth/leaves, regularization (20–50 Optuna trials).\n  - Class imbalance: per-class weights or focal loss equivalents.\n- Ensembling/stacking\n  - Weight by OOF AUC; never equal-weight weak models.\n  - Simple average of top tabular variants; optional meta-learner on OOF.\n- CNN path (only if environment stable)\n  - Pin versions: torch 2.0.0, torchvision 0.15.1, timm 0.6.12, albumentations 1.3.1, opencv-python-headless 4.8.0.74.\n  - Force CPU, small batch (≤8), torch.set_num_threads(1). Train 10–15 epochs, add augmentations, then average logits with tabular weighted by OOF.\n\nWorkflow hygiene\n- Log per-class AUC; timestamp all artifacts (oof/test) to avoid overwrites.\n- After each training, immediately evaluate OOF in Cell 12 and submit only the best.\n- If kernel/env crashes persist, restart or isolate minimal scripts.\n\nTargets\n- Short-term: restore ~0.834 OOF and 3-seed averaging to approach ≥0.87 LB.\n- Medium-term: with features/tuning/clean ensembling, push OOF toward ~0.88 for bronze safety."

Finally, I’ll make sure to print results and persist interim ID files early.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 4,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Strong tabular model: aggregate segment_features + rectangles, GroupKFold by station, OVR LightGBM (robust + periodic saves)\",\n      \"import numpy as np, pandas as pd, time, re, glob, sys, os\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold\",\n      \"\",\n      \"t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# 1) Load core metadata\",\n      \"sp_df = pd.read_csv('essential_data/species_list.txt')\",\n      \"num_classes = sp_df.shape[0]\",\n      \"cv_df = pd.read_csv('essential_data/CVfolds_2.txt')\",\n      \"rec_map = pd.read_csv('essential_data/rec_id2filename.txt')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# station group from filename prefix before first '_'\",\n      \"rec_map['station'] = rec_map['filename'].str.split('_').str[0]\",\n      \"meta = cv_df.merge(rec_map, on='rec_id', how='left')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# 2) Parse labels (skip '?' lines;

    "llm_json": "**Adjusting model evaluations**\n\nI need to fix the evaluation process according to expert guidance. I’ll modify Cell 12 to load per model train IDs if they exist and reorder Y_train accordingly. Models without IDs or with mismatched IDs should be skipped. I’ll also check the test IDs file for alignment. For candidate prefixes, I’ll look for *_train_ids.npy and *_test_ids.npy, but we'll skip models like advtab if they lack these IDs. I must ensure we don't completely refuse options; we can use naive alignment with warnings when necessary.**Selecting and regenerating training arrays**\n\nThe goal is to select the best models, but advtab is weak, and tab_strong has issues due to misalignment. With the correct IDs, tab_strong could potentially be stronger. We need to regenerate the tab_strong arrays with the updated Cell 4, including IDs. However, it seems we don’t have current tab_strong_train_ids.npy files saved, which means we should execute Cell 4 to generate them. Before that, I’ll modify Cell 12 for ID alignment and then run Cell 4. I can only work on one tool for now.**Editing Cell 12 for candidate mapping**\n\nI’m going to edit Cell 12 to implement the per-candidate mapping logic. For each candidate, I'll define a prefix, like tab_strong, to expect associated files like tab_strong_oof.npy and the corresponding train and test IDs from tab_strong_train_ids.npy and tab_strong_test_ids.npy.\n\nI need to load the out-of-fold (oof) data and the train IDs if they exist, then build the Y_train_map by mapping rec_id to labels. I'll ensure the length matches correctly, as the oof might only include rows associated with the train mask. \n\nNext, I’ll compute the AUC using Y_aligned.

I see that some output files were created at 01:02:30, which lines up with when we launched it. But it's still executing without reaching the training outputs. I realize we already have some outputs saved, possibly from a previous run. The scores seem low, and I'm considering if features or folds might be the issue.**Analyzing oof completion**\n\nIt seems I need to analyze why we're computing oof before filling predictions. Our oof has zeros for some classes, likely due to an early stop. Cell 4 is still running, but maybe it hasn't saved the final oof yet. It seems like it saved temporary results after each class and the final oof at the beginning due to the code structure. There's a chance this oof is from a previous execution. I think I should interrupt it and then re-run Cell 12 once everything is properly completed.**Reassessing model strategy**\n\nSince CNN is blocked, I think I should revert to using logistic regression on the histogram, which had an oof score of 0.662, and create a submission from that. The leaderboard might get close to 0.79, but the target medal requires at least 0.873. Training seems to be hanging, maybe due to heavy aggregation with many columns affecting performance. I could try reducing the aggregation set to speed things up. I should first interrupt Cell 4 to free the kernel, then run Cell 12 to evaluate the existing arrays.**Evaluating model improvements**\n\nAccording to the expert plan, I've fixed alignment and handled degenerate folds, but I still need to add station priors and coverage features. Advanced tab in Cell 8 had some elements, but the performance was poor, likely due to the alignment issue not being properly dealt with. I'm considering implementing Phase 1 correctly to save train IDs and evaluate with Cell 12. There might also be issues with species_list parsing, as it showed 20 but correctly reads as 19 elsewhere. I believe I should let Cell 4 finish running for now and wait a bit longer.**Deciding on logging**\n\nI’m thinking about adding logging to print information after the aggregation to help track where it stops executing. It seems like it's already past that point, so maybe it's a bit late for that. For now, I believe waiting for just three more minutes might be the best option.

Interestingly, a file exists with a timestamp indicating it saved early—possibly due to an earlier version. The current approach is stalling progress, so we definitely need a faster method. Building a simpler aggregation to avoid slow custom functions could help. Alternatively, we could consider a logistic baseline, but for a stronger model, implementing \"strong tabular v3\" using numeric segment features might be the best bet.**Creating a New Cell**\n\nI plan to add a new cell at the end, specifically index 13. This will involve parsing labels, loading segment features into a DataFrame, merging rectangles, and incorporating duration and frequency span. I want to keep the aggregation to just basic functions like mean, std, min, max, and median to speed things up—skipping custom percentile functions. After that, I’ll group by 'rec_id', flatten the columns, and build features to fit LightGBM with fewer trees for quicker results. I'll also make sure to save the relevant ID files, update the candidates list in Cell 12, and evaluate AUC locally.**Modifying Cells and Adding a New One**\n\nI'm considering whether we can modify Cell 12 to dynamically include any prefix with the files, or we could simply add 'tab_fast' as a candidate. I think the best approach is to first insert a new cell at index 13 for the 'tab_fast' training, then execute it. Afterward, I can modify Cell 12 to include the candidate. However, since we have a lot of steps to take, it's fine to add the candidate upfront. Given that we can only use one tool per turn, I’ll proceed with implementing the new cell with a fast pipeline and periodic log printing.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 13,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Fast tabular model (tab_fast): simplified aggregations (mean/std/min/max/median), GroupKFold by station, robust LGBM with ID alignment\",\n      \"import numpy as np, pandas as pd, sys, time, os\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"\",\n      \"t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"sp_df = pd.read_csv('essential_data/species_list.txt');

The current best out-of-fold (OOF) score is 0.583 from the tab_fast model, while the logistic histogram baseline had 0.662. However, Cell 12 doesn’t include this as a candidate. We have to improve this as time is uncertain. Integrating the histogram logistic approach from Cell 3 with GroupKFold by station seems like a logical next step. I’ll add a code cell for training the \"hist_lr_group\" model using these features.**Adjusting model cells**\n\nI need to modify Cell 12 to add the new candidate 'hist_lr' and execute it to hopefully surpass the 0.583 score. It should be close to the earlier 0.662 OOF, maybe slightly lower due to grouping. I’ll insert a new cell (index 14) with code to parse labels and histogram features, applying GroupKFold by station.

    "llm_json": "**Exploring model improvement steps**\n\nI need to focus on the next steps after generating the submission.csv from hist_lr, which has an OOF of 0.6236, below the medal thresholds. It's crucial to improve quickly, but I'm limited to using one tool at a time. There's a suggestion to open a new notebook due to IDE performance warnings, but modeling is the priority. I wonder if I could enhance the hist_lr by adding SVD or using a weighted blend approach instead to optimize predictions.**Considering blended submission approach**\n\nI see that I need to create a blended submission by mapping rec_id and class id. I can compute test predictions for each model, resulting in matrices based on rec_id mapping. For every rec_id, I'll calculate a weighted average of probabilities. I plan to insert a new cell for blending hist_lr, tab_fast, and possibly advtab. I'll evaluate the best weight grid and align OOF data to ensure accuracy during blending, ultimately to produce the final submission.csv.**Implementing station priors**\n\nI want to print the blended OOF and weights because adding complementary features could potentially increase my score from 0.6236 to around 0.66, although reaching the medal threshold seems unlikely. Since I don't have time to build a CNN, another approach is to include station priors in the hist_lr features by adding them as additional features through a pipeline. I’ll modify cell 14 to calculate and append fold-wise station priors. I'll ensure to capture station arrays before cross-validation and compute the means per station string during each fold loop.**Ensuring pipeline effectiveness**\n\nI need to ensure that the pipeline incorporates StandardScaler properly, as that could help improve the OOF score. So, I’ll modify cell 14 to include this adjustment and run it, which should be a quick process—around 0.5 seconds. After that, I’ll re-run cell 12 to evaluate and select the best features.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating tabular data improvement**\n\nI need to focus on recovering a strong tabular format with proper alignment, but I’m noticing cell 4 is stalling in aggregation due to q10/q90 functions being really slow. It had previously stalled before finishing aggregation too. I wonder if using numpy percentiles with groupby.apply could speed things up? Alternatively, I could use faster functions. Historically, the best tabular result on this dataset might reach around 0.85 with engineered features, but that's a time commitment. I could also consider ensemble methods to boost performance.**Considering blending strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about using per-seed averaging for hist_lr with different random states in KFold grouping. Unfortunately, GroupKFold doesn't allow shuffling, which is a limitation. I could try repeated stratification by creating different group splits, but that’s not trivial. I might switch the solver to saga and apply L1 regularization for sparsity. Given the urgency, I should re-run Cell 12 after SVD updates, although that feels minimal. I think I’ll implement a simple blend cell to combine hist_lr and tab_fast while aligned to maximize macro AUC for predictions.**Evaluating model enhancements**\n\nI’m wondering if we can bump our score from 0.639 to around 0.66. I’m thinking about adding a station prior to tab_fast in LGBM, which might help improve it to about 0.65. Modifying Cell 13 to incorporate a within-fold station prior feature, similar to what we did for hist, could yield modest improvements. I’ll create Cell 15 to blend hist_lr and tab_fast using aligned training IDs and calculate the macro AUC. I’ll make sure to save the blended test data properly while keeping track of the order!**Updating Cell 12**\n\nI think I should modify Cell 12 to include 'blend1.' It's a straightforward change, and it makes sense to integrate the blending results into that cell. I'll go ahead and implement it now.

Current best OOF is 0.6889 from a blend of hist_lr (histogram + station prior + per-fold SVD) and tab_fast (simplified segment aggregations LGBM). CNN path is blocked by environment and time. The original strong tabular cell (Cell 4) that once showed ~0.834 was confirmed leaky and now stalls on heavy groupby with custom quantiles; its re-runs yield ~0.49 AUC or hang. Request targeted guidance to reach >=0.87 Macro AUC with tabular-only under time constraints. Key questions: 1) Fastest winning feature set from provided text features (segment_features + rectangles + histogram_of_segments) to reach bronze: which aggregations/pooling are essential (e.g., segment count, duration/freq coverage, top-k per rec based on energy/duration, station priors, per-station/class priors within fold, SVD/PCA of hist)? 2) Our LGBM frequently shows 'No further splits with positive gain' and many degenerate folds for rare classes using GroupKFold by station (5 splits). What split strategy/params would you use (e.g., reduce to 3 folds, different seeds/reshuffles of groups, min_data_in_bin, min_child_samples, monotone constraints, feature selection) to ensure learnable splits and improve AUC? 3) Is there a proven compact tabular recipe (e.g., histogram SVD + station prior + LR/XGB) that reliably hits ~0.85+ here? If so, please outline exact steps and reasonable hyperparameters. 4) For our stalled Cell 4: best way to compute q10/q90 at scale without hanging (vectorized groupby.quantile vs numpy percentiles), or should we drop custom quantiles altogether? 5) Any quick ensembling tips across our current models (hist_lr, tab_fast) that could add +0.05\\u20130.1 AUC (e.g., class-wise blending weights via OOF, isotonic/Platt calibration per class, stacking with ridge using OOF)? We will implement your prioritized plan immediately in a fresh, slim notebook to improve performance health and iterate rapidly.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "Your current 0.6889 OOF is a stable baseline; the previous 0.834 score was a data leak and must be ignored. Your primary blockers are solvable implementation issues, not flawed concepts. The path to a bronze medal (≥0.87 AUC) is clear and requires executing the following steps in a new, clean notebook.\n\n**1. Immediate Fixes & Core Feature Engineering**\n\n-   **Remove Custom Quantiles:** The `groupby.agg` with custom `q10`/`q90` functions is the source of your hanging cells. Drop them immediately. The combination of `mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`, and `median` is sufficient and fast.\n-   **Core Aggregations:** On `segment_features` and `rectangles`, group by `rec_id` and compute `mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `median`, and `count`/`sum`.\n-   **Engineered Features:**\n    -   Create `duration = t_end - t_start` and `freq_span = f_end - f_start` at the segment level before aggregating.\n    -   Create record-level features: `has_segments` (0/1 indicator), `segment_density = segment_count / (t_max - t_min + 1)`, and `coverage_ratio = sum(duration) / rec_duration`.\n-   **Per-Fold Station Prior:** This is a critical, high-impact feature. Inside each fold's training loop, compute the mean target for each station using only the training data for that fold. Map this value to your train, validation, and test sets.\n-   **Per-Fold Histogram SVD:** L1-normalize the histogram data. Inside each fold's training loop, fit a `TruncatedSVD(n_components=16-24)` on the training data and use it to transform the train, validation, and test sets for that fold.\n-   **Data Handling:** Do not use global `fillna(0)`. Preserve NaNs for the tree models to interpret.\n\n**2. Robust Validation and Training**\n\n-   **Validation Strategy:** Switch to `GroupKFold(n_splits=3)` grouped by station. This increases samples per fold and reduces the chance of degenerate folds (no positive samples for a class). For more stability, consider using repeated K-Fold (e.g., 3 folds with 3-5 different random seeds/repeats), pre-screening and rejecting any split where a class has zero positive samples in a validation set.\n-   **Guard Clause:** Maintain a check for any remaining degenerate folds. If a validation set has no positive samples for a class, predict the training fold's mean target.\n-   **LGBM Parameters:** Your current parameters are too aggressive. Use a robust set:\n    -   `objective: 'binary'`, `learning_rate: 0.01-0.03`, `num_leaves: 31`\n    -   `n_estimators: 2000+` with `early_stopping_rounds: 100-150`\n    -   `min_child_samples: 10-20`, `min_data_in_bin: 1-3`\n    -   `subsample: 0.9`, `colsample_bytree: 0.9`, `reg_lambda: 1.0-2.0`\n    -   `scale_pos_weight`: Compute this per-class on each training fold (`neg_count / pos_count`).\n\n**3. Ensembling for the Final Score Boost**\n\n-   **Foundation (Seed Averaging):** The simplest and most reliable first step. Train your single strong LGBM model 3 times using different `random_state` seeds and average the predictions. This alone provides a significant boost.\n-   **Model Diversity:** For a stronger ensemble, introduce diversity:\n    1.  **LGBM:** Your primary model with the features above.\n    2.  **XGBoost:** Train an XGBoost model on the same features for diversity (`max_depth=4`, `learning_rate=0.03`, `n_estimators=2500+`).\n    3.  **Simple Model:** Train a `LogisticRegression` using only the per-fold SVD features and the station prior.\n-   **Stacking/Blending:**\n    -   **Stacking (Recommended):** Use the Out-of-Fold (OOF) predictions from your base models (LGBM, XGB, LR) as features for a simple meta-learner (e.g., `Ridge` or `LogisticRegression`) to make the final predictions.\n    -   **Blending (Faster Alternative):** For each of the 19 classes, find the optimal blending weights for your model predictions by maximizing AUC on the OOF set.\n-   **Calibration (Optional):** As a final step, consider applying per-class `IsotonicRegression` on your final OOF predictions to calibrate probabilities before submission.\n\n**Prioritized Action Plan:**\n\n1.  **Fix & Baseline:** In a new notebook, implement the immediate fixes (remove quantiles, use 3 folds, robust LGBM params). This should raise your baseline to ~0.80 AUC.\n2.  **Build Strong Single Model:** Add the full feature set (station priors, SVD, density features). Train with seed averaging. This should target 0.85-0.88 AUC.\n3.  **Ensemble to Win:** Add XGBoost and/or the simple LR model. Use stacking or class-wise blending on OOF predictions to push your score above the 0.87 bronze medal threshold.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: raise the strong tabular baseline to reliable OOF ≥0.87 and submit clean, ID-aligned outputs; use small, validated blends only.\n\nStatus and gap\n- Current LB 0.8404; bronze ≥0.87372 (≈+0.033).\n- Best OOF so far 0.8341 (Cell 4 strong tabular). Later models regressed; CNN path blocked; validation/ID alignment issues likely.\n\nRoot issues to fix\n- Broken validation and ID alignment; possible leakage.\n- Model drift from strong baseline; degraded features/blends.\n- Unstable training and submission hygiene.\n\nImmediate actions (today)\n- Re-run the proven Cell 4 pipeline to completion with GroupKFold by station, early stopping, no interruptions. Save:\n  - tab_strong_oof.npy, tab_strong_test.npy, tab_strong_train_ids.npy, tab_strong_test_ids.npy\n- Training settings:\n  - n_estimators 1000–2000 (up to 3000 if time) with early_stopping_rounds 50–100\n  - 3–5 random seeds; average predictions\n  - fillna(0), drop zero/near-constant features per fold\n  - scale_pos_weight per fold; consider num_leaves 31–63, learning_rate 0.01–0.05, min_child_samples 10–20, min_data_in_bin 5–15, reg_lambda 1–5\n- Rerun Cell 12 to evaluate OOF with strict ID alignment; select best model; write versioned submissions (submission_tab_strong_v1.csv). Do not rely on advtab/blend1.\n\nTargeted improvements (low risk, high ROI)\n- Features (add few, fold-safe):\n  - Rect aggregates: duration_mean/std, freq_span_mean/std, segment_count_total\n  - Histogram stats: entropy, top-5 bin ratios\n  - Per-station priors computed within folds only (no leakage)\n- Robust validation:\n  - GroupKFold by station; if class imbalance hurts, use StratifiedGroupKFold\n  - Log macro AUC and per-class AUC; skip submit if macro OOF <0.80\n  - Save OOF/test after each fold; verify ID order matches labels\n- Hyperparameter tuning:\n  - Small Optuna/grid over learning_rate, num_leaves, reg_lambda; keep early stopping\n\nEnsembling and alternatives\n- Simple, validated blends only:\n  - Blend tab_strong with hist_lr using OOF-optimized weight (search 0–1); ensure ID alignment\n  - Optionally add an XGBoost/CatBoost tabular variant for diversity if it matches/beats OOF\n- Avoid large “advanced” feature sets that hurt CV; keep CNNs optional\n  - If attempting CNN: force CPU, small batch, simpler model (ResNet18), only if stable\n  - Alternatively add MFCC/spectral GBDTs as a lightweight diverse model\n- Pseudo-labeling only after validation is stable\n\nSubmission hygiene and process\n- Version every submission; never overwrite; map LB scores to model configs\n- Always choose models by OOF first, then confirm on LB\n- Start with smaller n_estimators for debug; scale up for final runs\n\nExpected path to bronze\n- Clean multi-seed tab_strong + small, validated feature additions should lift OOF toward 0.86–0.88\n- A calibrated blend with hist_lr or a second GBDT can add +0.01–0.02 LB\n- Iterate 1–2 submissions guided by OOF and LB to cross ≥0.87372"

Since I can only do one action at a time, I should probably close main.ipynb to boost performance, even though training is ongoing. However, since they're recommending requesting an expert review at major milestones, I should follow that advice too.**Reassessing execution and performance**\n\nWe're currently in the middle of execution, and I think reaching out to experts could help clarify whether we should continue with these parameters, especially since I'm seeing warnings about \"No further splits with positive gain\". This might suggest too many features with constant values. However, previous models achieved decent out-of-fold scores. It could be a bug related to features that are mostly zero. We should let the current class iterations finish for now, then re-evaluate in about three minutes and consider closing main.ipynb later.**Deciding to wait for training**\n\nI'm planning to wait for three minutes to allow the training process to continue. This gives the model some time to make progress on the current tasks. I think it's important to check how things are going after that period.

The outputs indicate completion, but it would be good to check the OOF AUC printed output, even though it's truncated. I think we could add a cell to compute the macro AUC from the saved data. Then, I'll plan to implement XGBoost and LR stacking, and remember to request expert review as per our workflow!**Planning expert review**\n\nI just completed the strong LGBM model, and now it feels right to request an expert review to confirm our next steps. I'll reference production.ipynb and ask if the parameters are fine, plus report the observed AUC if we can compute it. I know we can request the review even without the AUC, but it’s better to include it. So, I think I’ll insert the evaluation cell now and execute it in the next turn for the results!**Preparing to evaluate AUC**\n\nI’m planning to add code in cell 3 to load the prod_lgb_* npy files and align the Y data with labels, using our existing label_map and rec_train. However, it'll be safer to recompute using the saved train IDs and the earlier label_map in the kernel since they're both readily available.

I’ll proceed with XGBoost and logistic regression and stick to our plan for stacking. It seems wise to request an expert review after developing a strong single model, given the low OOF score. I'll utilize the request_expert_review tool and explain our results, features, and the LightGBM warnings I'm seeing.**Considering model improvements and expert review**\n\nI’m thinking about additional improvements for our model, like logging transforms on counts and utilizing ratios such as coverage_ratio. I could look into including raw histogram features added directly to the base features, not just relying on SVD. Target encoding per class might also be helpful. For validation, using 5-fold GroupKFold could work with our 258 training samples. I need to add parameters like min_data_in_bin and feature_fraction too. I’ll choose to request expert review now and summarize any questions I have.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Milestone review: Built the clean production pipeline and trained the strong single model (LightGBM with GroupKFold=3 by station, per-fold station priors, per-fold SVD on L1-normalized histograms, 3-seed averaging). Result: prod_lgb OOF Macro AUC (ID-aligned) = 0.60784, which is far below the target and below our prior best blend (~0.689 from hist_lr + tab_fast in main.ipynb). Key details: - Data parsing confirmed correct (322 rows meta; 258 labeled train rec_ids; 64 test) - Fast per-segment aggregations (mean/std/min/max/median, plus engineered duration/freq_span/area; segment count) from segment_features + segment_rectangles, merged to meta; feature count ~231 before per-fold aug. - Per-fold station prior: one feature per class per fold (scalar per sample). - Per-fold SVD: n_components capped at 24, fit on H_train[tr_idx]; transform train/valid/test; columns appended. - LGBM: learning_rate=0.025, num_leaves=31, n_estimators=3200, subsample=0.9, colsample_bytree=0.9, min_child_samples=10, reg_lambda=1.5, scale_pos_weight per-fold; early_stopping=130; 3 seeds [42,7,2025], averaged. - Many LightGBM logs show 'No further splits with positive gain' repeatedly, suggesting feature issues or parameters not suited. Requests: 1) Please diagnose likely bottlenecks: a) Are our fast aggregations and engineered features insufficient? b) Is per-fold SVD setup correct or should we (i) reduce components; (ii) use global hist features directly; (iii) apply PCA/SVD on concatenated base+hist (with leakage-safe fitting)? c) Do you recommend 5-fold GroupKFold (by station) despite 258 train to stabilize? 2) Parameter guidance for this data: recommended LGBM params (max_bin, min_data_in_bin, min_data_in_leaf, feature_fraction/bagging_freq, monotone constraints?) to avoid the 'no positive gain' and improve AUC. 3) Feature suggestions proven to work for this challenge: ratios like coverage_ratio (sum duration / clip length), time/freq coverage counts, segment density per second, log transforms, interactions? 4) Ensembling path: We'll add XGBoost and Logistic Regression on the same feature set, then stack with a Ridge meta-learner. Any specific tuning tips (e.g., XGB depth/eta/subsample/colsample) and a recommended stacking CV scheme to avoid leakage? 5) Should we include raw histogram bins (100 dims) alongside SVD components and station priors for the tree models? 6) Any cautions about station priors: per-class target leakage risk or best practice smoothing to handle rare stations? Our next step after your feedback: adjust features (add coverage_ratio, density, raw hist), retune LGBM (possibly 5-fold GroupKFold and param set you recommend), then implement XGBoost + LR and a simple meta-learner stack. We'll keep strict ID alignment and detailed logging. Thank you.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Overall Diagnosis:**\nThe 0.60784 OOF AUC and 'No further splits' warnings are caused by a combination of missing high-impact features and model parameters that are incompatible with the small, imbalanced dataset. The model is being starved of predictive signals and is mathematically prevented from creating effective splits.\n\n**Priority 1: Critical Fixes to Achieve a Functional Model (>0.80 AUC)**\n\n1.  **Feature Processing:**\n    *   **Stop `fillna(0.0)`:** This is the most harmful step. It destroys the crucial signal of whether a recording has segments. Remove the global `fillna(0.0)` and let LightGBM handle NaNs, which it does natively.\n    *   **Add `has_segments` Feature:** Create a binary feature `has_segments = (~df['segment_count_total'].isna()).astype(int)` to explicitly capture whether segments are present.\n    *   **Fill Strategically:** For recordings with no segments, only `segment_count_total` should be filled with 0. All other aggregated features should remain NaN.\n\n2.  **Feature Engineering:**\n    *   Implement the missing critical record-level features. The clip duration is 10 seconds.\n        *   `coverage_ratio = segment_count_total * duration_mean / 10.0`\n        *   `segment_density = segment_count_total / 10.0`\n        *   `freq_coverage = (f_end_max - f_start_min) / 8000.0` (or similar range)\n        *   Log transforms on skewed features: `np.log1p()` on `duration_mean`, `area_tf_mean`, `segment_count_total`.\n        *   Interaction feature: `duration_mean * freq_span_mean`.\n\n3.  **LightGBM Hyperparameters:**\n    *   The current parameters are preventing the model from training on rare classes.\n    *   **`min_child_samples`:** Lower immediately to `5` (or even `2`). The current value of `10` makes it impossible to create splits when a fold has fewer than 10 positive samples for a class.\n    *   **Binning:** Set `max_bin=128` and `min_data_in_bin=3`. The default `max_bin=255` is too high for the small number of samples and flat features.\n    *   **Regularization:** Add `feature_fraction=0.7` and `bagging_freq=1` to improve robustness.\n    *   **Learning Rate:** Lower to `0.015` or `0.02` for more stable convergence.\n\n**Priority 2: Optimization for a Strong Single Model (>0.85 AUC)**\n\n1.  **Station Priors:**\n    *   Your per-fold implementation is leakage-safe, but it's vulnerable to overfitting on rare stations.\n    *   **Action:** Add Bayesian smoothing. Replace the simple mean with a smoothed mean: `prior = (station_sum + alpha * global_mean) / (station_count + alpha)`, where `alpha` is a smoothing parameter (e.g., 5).\n\n2.  **Histogram Features:**\n    *   **SVD:** Reduce `n_components` from 24 to a more robust 12-16 to limit noise injection.\n    *   **Raw Bins:** Add the raw histogram bins (e.g., top 50 or all 100) as features *in addition to* the SVD components for tree-based models. This gives the model multiple views of the data.\n\n3.  **Cross-Validation Strategy:**\n    *   Stick with 3-fold `GroupKFold` by station. With extreme class imbalance, 5-fold CV risks creating validation folds with zero positive samples for some classes.\n    *   For more stability, repeat the 3-fold CV 2-3 times with different random seeds and average the OOF/test predictions.\n\n**Priority 3: Ensembling for Medal Contention**\n\n*Do not proceed until your single LGBM model achieves >0.85 AUC.*\n\n1.  **Model Diversity:**\n    *   **XGBoost:** Train an XGBoost model using similar features. Use parameters like `max_depth=4`, `eta=0.02`, `subsample=0.8`, `colsample_bytree=0.8`, `min_child_weight=5`.\n    *   **Logistic Regression:** Train a simple Logistic Regression model on a limited set of dense, leakage-safe features: the station priors and the SVD components.\n\n2.  **Stacking:**\n    *   Use a leakage-safe stacking scheme. Generate OOF predictions from your base models (LGBM, XGB) using the exact same 3-fold `GroupKFold` structure.\n    *   Train a meta-learner (e.g., `Ridge(alpha=1.0)` or `LogisticRegression`) on these OOF predictions as its features.\n    *   For the final test prediction, feed the averaged test predictions from your base models into the trained meta-learner.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: prioritize fixing validation/imbalance, strengthen a single model, then add diverse models and stack.\n\n- Fix validation and imbalance (critical)\n  - Use StratifiedGroupKFold if feasible; otherwise RepeatedGroupKFold (3 folds × 3 repeats) by station and average across repeats/seeds. Ensure each fold has positives per class; if impossible, merge rare classes’ folds or skip fold for that class.\n  - Keep per-class scale_pos_weight per fold. Raise min_child_samples to 20–40, add reg_lambda 1–5 (and/or reg_alpha ~0.5), feature_fraction/bagging_fraction 0.7–0.9, and consider boosting_type='dart' if learning stalls.\n  - Increase early_stopping_rounds to 150–200 and n_estimators to ~5000 with learning_rate 0.01–0.02. Optionally min_gain_to_split=0.01.\n\n- Strengthen features\n  - Add coverage/density metrics: segment_count, segment_density, time_coverage (sum duration / clip length), freq_coverage (sum freq_span / range), per-feature count aggs.\n  - Use both raw histogram features (top 50–100 bins or summed bands) and per-fold SVD/PCA features on L1-normalized histograms. Fix n_components to 16–24; if folds are tiny, fit PCA on train-only once and transform folds.\n  - Add simple audio descriptors from segments if available: spectral centroid, rolloff; temporal patterns (gaps between segments, timing distributions); station × time-of-day priors.\n  - Prune zero-variance/noisy cols; standardize features for linear models.\n\n- Recover a strong single model (LGBM target OOF ≥0.82–0.85)\n  - Params guideline: num_leaves 15–31, min_child_samples 20–40, reg_lambda 1–5, feature_fraction 0.7–0.9, bagging_fraction 0.7–0.9, learning_rate 0.01–0.02, n_estimators 4000–6000, early_stopping 150–200. Keep per-class spw. Average 3–5 seeds.\n  - Sanity checks: run a per-class LogisticRegression baseline (balanced, scaled) to confirm data/feature viability (~0.65+ OOF). Investigate degenerate classes; use fold priors or small-epsilon constants when pos/neg are zero.\n\n- Complete the ensemble (expected +0.02–0.04 AUC)\n  - XGBoost per class: binary:logistic, eta 0.02–0.03, max_depth 4–6, min_child_weight 2–5, subsample 0.8, colsample_bytree 0.8, lambda 1–5, n_estimators 4000+, early_stopping 200; use spw. Same CV/seeds.\n  - Logistic Regression per class: StandardScaler, solver saga/liblinear, class_weight='balanced', C in [0.25, 0.5, 1, 2]. Same CV/seeds.\n  - Optional CatBoost for diversity if time allows.\n  - Save OOF/test for all models; stack OOFs as meta-features. Meta-learner per class: Ridge or LogisticRegression (balanced) with GroupKFold; blend meta output with best base (e.g., 0.6 meta + 0.4 best base) if more stable. Alternatively weighted average (e.g., 0.5 LGBM, 0.3 XGB, 0.2 LR) based on OOF.\n\n- Calibration, post-processing, and hygiene\n  - Calibrate probabilities (isotonic or Platt) using CV; clip predictions to [1e-3, 1 - 1e-3].\n  - Strict ID alignment; average test predictions exactly as done for OOF across folds/seeds/repeats.\n  - Feature selection (optional): permutation importance or RFECV to drop noisy features for LR.\n  - Submit iteratively; if stuck, blend prior best (blend1) with new models.\n\nConcise action plan\n1) Switch to StratifiedGroupKFold or RepeatedGroupKFold; increase regularization/bagging; fix SVD components; add coverage/density and raw histogram features.  \n2) Tune LGBM with the above params; 3–5 seeds; target OOF ≥0.82–0.85.  \n3) Train XGB and LR with same CV; save OOF/test; stack with Ridge/LR meta.  \n4) Calibrate, blend, and resubmit. Target LB ≥0.8737 for bronze."

    "llm_json": "**Implementing expert changes**\n\nI need to focus on expert feedback regarding our model adjustments. I'll remove fillna(0.0) and add features like has_segments and engineered features while tweaking LGBM parameters. We should reduce SVD components and include raw histogram bins as features, ensuring we don't fill NaNs globally. I'm considering how to create features like coverage_ratio and segment_density, potentially adding histogram bins to training data simply. I’ll also modify the setup cell in production.ipynb to align with these changes.**Adjusting feature engineering**\n\nI need to make specific changes in cell 1, starting with merging data frames and creating the has_segments feature by checking for NaNs in the gb columns. For 'segment_count_total', I'll fill NaN values with 0, but not for others. LGBM can handle NaNs, so I won't call fillna(0.0). I'll also engineer features like duration_mean and freq_span_mean using aggregated columns. Segment_density and coverage_ratio will be calculated based on segment counts. Finally, I'll adjust training parameters, including SVD components and add raw histogram bins.**Modifying features and LGBM settings**\n\nI’m thinking about adding the top 100 columns to features in order to manage the number of columns effectively. I’ll combine the training set with the new features per fold and adjust some LGBM parameters, like setting min_child_samples to 5 and the learning rate to 0.02. Since only one cell can be edited per turn according to the tool's rules, I will start by modifying cell 1 to process features, such as removing fillna(0.0) and setting up engineered features safely.**Updating feature extraction**\n\nI need to make sure I update the extraction for X_base properly. This means excluding the meta columns but including the engineered features, and I'll definitely keep the NaNs intact. So, I'll craft the modification specifically for cell 1 to reflect these changes.

    "llm_json": "**Modifying code for performance**\n\nI'm looking to make some code modifications. First, I'll replace prior calculations with a smoothing method. I have defined an alpha value for the global mean and used it to compute station-specific values.\n\nNext, I want to implement SVD components, capping them to 16. I need to ensure proper dimensions with a check on minimum values.\n\nFinally, I'm considering adding raw histogram bins by creating DataFrame columns for each, but I have performance concerns about looping over 100 bins for each class and fold. Aiming to precompute constant features will help!**Streamlining edits while considering performance**\n\nI want to keep my edits minimal to work within the constraints, especially since the dataset is small. It might be a good idea to prebuild the DataFrames, X_base_with_hist, to simplify things, although that could complicate edits.\n\nFor performance, I need to account for each class multiplied by three folds and three seeds, leading to numerous column assignments. Setting parameters like early stopping, the number of estimators, handling NaNs, and modifying the learning rate will help optimize the model.

I'm planning to modify cell 2 to prevent DataFrame fragmentation by using numpy concatenation for additional features (like st_prior as a vector, H bins, and SVD). I should also consider reducing logging. \n\nTo streamline the process, I’ll build matrices instead of inserting into a DataFrame. I’ll start with X_base_df.values, create extra arrays, and concatenate them to enhance performance. I'll implement NaN handling too, ensuring computations are efficient.**Structuring feature arrays**\n\nI need to build feature arrays for training by combining parts_tr, which includes Xb_tr, st_tr_feat[:, None], and H_tr. If n_comp is greater than or equal to 2, I’ll also add Z_tr. I'll do the same for validation and test sets. \n\nAfter creating these arrays, I’ll fit the LGBM model using these new structures while maintaining the same parameters as before.

Currently, things like min_child_samples and min_gain_to_split are too high. I'll lower min_gain_to_split to 0, and adjust min_child_samples and max_bin to be more flexible. I’m also considering increasing num_leaves and maybe adjusting the learning rate. I’ll look into enabling class_weight and adjusting other parameters to optimize performance, while keeping some settings consistent to avoid issues.**Updating parameters in the notebook**\n\nI need to log fold progress, so I’m thinking I should edit the notebook now. I’ll modify Cell 2 to adjust several parameters: I’ll set num_leaves to 127, max_bin to 255, and other values like min_child_samples to 1 and learning_rate to 0.03. It seems important to also keep early_stopping at 200 rounds. I’ll make minor adjustments like setting deterministic parameters and ensure to print out the shapes. I’m excited to see how these updates improve the model!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 2,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Strong single model: LGBM with GroupKFold(n_splits=3), per-fold station priors + SVD on hist, 3-seed averaging\",\n      \"import sys, subprocess, time\",\n      \"try:\",\n      \"    import lightgbm as lgb\",\n      \"    from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\",\n      \"except Exception:\",\n      \"    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', 'lightgbm'])\",\n      \"    import lightgbm as lgb\",\n      \"    from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\",\n      \"\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('Starting LGBM training...')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Base matrices\",\n      \"X_base_df = pd.DataFrame(X_base, columns=feat_cols)\",\n      \"X_test_df = pd.DataFrame(X_test_base, columns=feat_cols)\",\n      \"X_base_mat = X_base_df.to_numpy(np.float32)\",\n      \"X_test_mat = X_test_df.to_numpy(np.float32)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"gkf = GroupKFold(n_splits=3)\",\n      \"n_train = X_base_df.shape[0]\",\n      \"n_test = X_test_df.shape[0]\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def run_seed(seed):\",\n      \"    oof = np.zeros((n_train, num_classes), dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"    te = np.zeros((n_test, num_classes), dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"    for c in range(num_classes):\",\n      \"        y = Y_train[:, c].astype(int)\",\n      \"        cls_oof = np.zeros(n_train, dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"        cls_te_acc = np.zeros(n_test, dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"        fold_no = 0\",\n      \"        for tr_idx, va_idx in gkf.split(X_base_df, y, groups):\",\n      \"            fold_no += 1\",\n      \"            tstart = time.time()\",\n      \"            Xb_tr = X_base_mat[tr_idx];

    "llm_json": "**Troubleshooting LightGBM parameters**\n\nI'm noticing that despite modifying parameters, the output still shows a warning about `min_gain_to_split` set to 0.01 instead of the 0.0 I set. It seems like LightGBM might still be using the default for `min_split_gain`. It's possible our changes didn’t take effect because the model was partially executed before the modifications were confirmed. The log indicates that our `min_split_gain` parameter isn’t applied. I need to clarify this further!**Addressing parameter conflicts**\n\nI'm seeing a warning about a parameter conflict, where `min_split_gain=0.0` is ignored, and `min_gain_to_split` is set at 0.01. This suggests another setting might be using that value. Maybe it's a global parameter or something in the dataset? To be safe, I think I should set both parameters to 0.0 and possibly look into `feature_fraction_bynode`. The warning about no further splits could mean restrictions are too tight or features are constant due to NaNs. I'll need to keep investigating!**Modifying parameters for model training**\n\nI’m noticing that when the positive class is rare, histogram features might end up as all zeros. However, base features can still provide valuable information. I think applying L1 normalization may cause some issues. First, I need to execute the cell with the corrected parameters to ensure `min_gain_to_split` is set to 0.0. I’ll set both `min_gain_to_split` and `min_split_gain` to 0.0, then adjust some other settings to improve the model's performance. It's really important to keep tweaking these parameters!**Updating model parameters**\n\nI’ve decided to modify the model parameters and print the LightGBM version along with the parameters for transparency. In cell 2, I’ll add a print statement for the version, set `min_split_gain` to 0.0, and keep `scale_pos_weight` in the mix. Setting `max_bin` to 255 seems fine, and turning `feature_pre_filter` off can help prevent unwanted feature removal, especially since it could lead to no splits when hessian values are small. After making these changes, I'll execute cell 2 and consider getting an expert review afterward!**Executing cell 2**\n\nIt's time to move forward and execute cell 2. I’ve made all the necessary adjustments to the parameters, and now it's important to run the cell to see how the model performs with these changes. This step is crucial for assessing whether the modifications I've implemented will lead to improved results. I’m eager to see the outcome and ready for any further adjustments if needed!

    "llm_json": "**Investigating LGBMClassifier splits**\n\nIn LGBMClassifier, the max_depth being -1 might lead to the \"no further splits\" issue; however, with min_child_samples set to 1, it shouldn't be problematic. I wonder if all training weights being zero could be the reason. Even though I set scale_pos_weight large, the problem persists. I'm considering factors like monotone constraints, NaN values in labels, or the effect of feature_pre_filter. I’ll also check if all features are constant or have just one unique non-NaN value.**Exploring feature issues in data prep**\n\nAfter data preparation, it seems many features might turn into NaN for certain rows, particularly those without segments. For rows with segments, should we not still split on has_segments or segment_count_total? We also added raw histogram features, which are L1-normalized and shouldn’t be constant. I’m concerned that converting to numpy might accidentally yield a single unique value per feature due to type mismatches. LightGBM shows 344 features from 167 rows but still finds no splits. I should try adjusting feature_pre_filter settings to see if that helps.**Analyzing loss and split issues**\n\nI'm considering that our loss function is based on AUC, and we're using AUC as our evaluation metric, but the training objective is binary logloss, which shouldn’t be an issue. I think we should pause execution and adjust parameters like setting feature_pre_filter to False and ensuring deterministic processing. I’m unsure if lack of splits is a depth issue, but I wonder if all-NaN features could be a problem. LightGBM can handle NaNs, yet the -inf gain suggests no effective splits. I also need to check if I’m mistakenly using early_stopping with eval_only.**Deciding to interrupt execution**\n\nI'm recalling that in LightGBM, \"min_data_in_leaf\" is also known as min_child_samples, which is good. I wonder about using \"zero_as_missing\": True; could zeros indicate missingness? Even with zeros, splits should still be possible. I think we should pause execution and request an expert review to understand why there are persistent no-splits. The tool allows this while training, but I feel it's best to interrupt first to regain control.

    "llm_json": "**Analyzing training performance**\n\nI really need to take action since the training process isn't generating split warnings. It might be due to all features being NaN, although I have 344 features in use—239 base features plus some additional ones. LightGBM may not find positive gain because the labels have extremely small positives. Also, maybe sample weights are zero, or feature filtering is blocking splits. It looks like I'm getting repeating messages because it's trying each tree but finding no splits at all.**Investigating model issues**\n\nI'm running into issues where even with a minimum gain to split of zero, LightGBM indicates a best gain of negative infinity. That seems to suggest there's something wrong with the gradients and hessians, possibly due to constant labels. Even though the average prediction is non-zero, could it be that columns in X contain only NaNs? Still, it reports using 344 features, so there must be some non-NaN values. I’ll consider disabling feature pre-filtering and ensuring deterministic settings. It might be a good idea to request expert review at this stage to clarify the concerns.**Requesting expert review**\n\nThe workflow indicates that I should use the request_expert_review tool when I hit major checkpoints, and this feels like a significant modeling issue. I need to provide the notebook path and specify the assistance required, which includes diagnosing the “no further splits” issue and suggesting parameter sets and data checks. So, it's clear I should go ahead and request that expert review now to ensure I'm on the right track.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"We refactored Cell 2 (LGBM training) to avoid pandas fragmentation and relaxed constraints (num_leaves=127, max_bin=255, min_child_samples=1, min_gain_to_split=0, etc.). Training still spams 'No further splits with positive gain, best gain: -inf' even with small folds (e.g., 3 pos / 164 neg) and ~344 used features (base feats + station prior + raw hist + per-fold SVD). Data prep (Cell 1) leaves NaNs except for selective fills; added has_segments, coverage_ratio, segment_density, freq_coverage, logs, and interaction. Hist rows are L1-normalized floats; SVD reduces to up to 16 comps per fold. We also use scale_pos_weight and early stopping=200. Despite this, every boosting iteration shows no splits. We suspect feature_pre_filter removing everything or a data/NaN handling issue. Please advise on: 1) Root causes for -inf split gains in LightGBM under extreme imbalance with NaNs; 2) Exact parameter set to unblock splits (e.g., feature_pre_filter=False, min_data_in_leaf=1 vs min_sum_hessian_in_leaf, force_col_wise=True, zero_as_missing handling); 3) Any obvious data issues in our fold-wise matrices (e.g., need to impute has_segments differently). We can quickly patch Cell 2 per your recommendation.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Diagnosis & Root Cause**\nThe model fails to train (logs show \"best gain: -inf\") because default LightGBM parameters are incompatible with the dataset's characteristics: extreme class imbalance (e.g., 3 positive/164 negative samples), small fold size (~170 samples), and a high number of features (~344) with many NaNs. The primary culprit is `feature_pre_filter=True`, which incorrectly discards all features as uninformative before training begins.\n\n**Data Preparation Assessment**\nYour data preparation in Cell 1 is correct and competition-grade. The selective NaN handling, creation of the `has_segments` flag, and feature engineering choices are strong. Do not modify the data preparation; the issue is isolated to model parameters.\n\n**Critical Parameter Fixes for Cell 2**\nThe following changes are essential to enable model training. They relax constraints to force the model to find splits in the sparse, imbalanced data.\n\n1.  **Disable Pre-filtering:** `feature_pre_filter=False`. This is the most critical change. It forces the model to evaluate all features instead of prematurely discarding them.\n2.  **Reduce Model Complexity:** The original `num_leaves=127` is far too high. Reduce it to a range of 15-31 and add a `max_depth` limit (e.g., 5-6) to stabilize initial splits and prevent immediate overfitting.\n3.  **Relax Leaf Constraints:** Set `min_child_samples=1` (or `min_data_in_leaf=1`) and drastically lower `min_sum_hessian_in_leaf` to `1e-5` or lower. This allows the model to create leaves containing the few, high-weight positive samples.\n4.  **Adjust Binning:** The default `max_bin=255` creates too many empty or sparse bins with few samples. Reduce it to a coarser value like 32, 64, or 96 to create more robust histograms.\n5.  **Ensure Stability & Correctness:** Set `force_col_wise=True` for better performance on small-N, high-dimension data. Set `zero_as_missing=False` to correctly distinguish true zeros in your features from NaNs.\n\n**Consolidated Parameter Set Example**\nReplace your `LGBMClassifier` parameters with a set similar to this:\n```python\nmodel = LGBMClassifier(\n    objective='binary',\n    n_estimators=8000,\n    learning_rate=0.03,\n    scale_pos_weight=spw,\n    random_state=seed,\n    n_jobs=-1,\n    # --- Critical Fixes ---\n    feature_pre_filter=False,\n    num_leaves=31,\n    max_depth=6,\n    max_bin=96,\n    min_child_samples=1,\n    min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=1e-5,\n    # --- Stability & Correctness ---\n    force_col_wise=True,\n    zero_as_missing=False,\n    # --- Standard Parameters ---\n    subsample=0.9,\n    colsample_bytree=0.9,\n    reg_lambda=0.1\n)\n```\n\n**Expected Outcome & Next Steps**\n- **Immediate:** After applying these changes, the model will train successfully. Expect `best_iteration` values > 1 and an OOF AUC score in the 0.80-0.85 range.\n- **Path to Medal:** Once this baseline is established, average predictions over 2-3 different seeds. Then, build an XGBoost model using similarly relaxed parameters and create a simple blend of the LGBM and XGB predictions to target a score ≥0.87.\n\n**Contingency & Debugging**\n- If the model still fails to split, add `extra_trees=True` to the parameters as a last resort to force random splits.\n- To isolate problematic features, try training on subsets (e.g., only SVD + station priors, then add other feature groups back) to see which group causes the failure.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: close a ~0.033 AUC gap by unblocking LightGBM learning, tightening features, and ensembling.\n\nStatus\n- Current LB 0.8404 < bronze 0.87372. Not on track.\n- Symptoms: “No further splits” in LGBM; OOF 0.607 vs LB 0.84 suggests bug/misalignment.\n\nImmediate fixes (Cell 2 LGBM) — make trees permissive, stop early, disable prefilter\n- Core settings (pick one starting point; keep scale_pos_weight=spw, GroupKFold):\n  - Option A (very permissive, fast): boosting_type='gbdt', learning_rate=0.05, num_leaves=255, n_estimators=4000, subsample=1.0, colsample_bytree=1.0, max_bin=128, min_child_samples=1, min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=1e-6, min_gain_to_split=0.0, feature_pre_filter=False, extra_trees=True.\n  - Option B (more conservative): boosting_type='goss', learning_rate=0.02, num_leaves=31, n_estimators=3000, subsample=0.9, colsample_bytree=0.9, max_bin=128, min_child_samples=1, min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=1e-5, reg_lambda=0.1.\n- Fit with early stopping and logs: callbacks=[early_stopping(120–150), log_evaluation(50)].\n- If still split-starved: reduce feature load (drop raw histogram; keep only SVD or top-variance 32–64 bins), cut SVD comps to 8–12.\n\nCritical debug checks (before/while training)\n- Verify label/row alignment and station-wise GroupKFold everywhere.\n- Confirm features have variance; disable feature prefiltering; ensure no test leakage in priors.\n- Sanity-check OOF pipeline (AUC calc, NaN handling, epsilon on constant preds).\n\nFeature/imbalance handling\n- Keep scale_pos_weight; consider slight L2 (reg_lambda 0.1) if overfitting.\n- Per-fold standardization for dense tabular features.\n- Optional: feature selection (variance/MI) to ~50–150 strongest features.\n\nEnsemble plan to push ≥0.873\n- After LGBM OOF ≥0.86:\n  - Add LogisticRegression (L2, class_weight via sample weights) on engineered+SVD features.\n  - Add XGBoost with permissive params (max_depth 6–8, min_child_weight ~0.1, subsample/colsample ~1.0, scale_pos_weight=spw).\n  - Blend by simple average or AUC-weighted; keep 3–5 seed averaging per model.\n\nIf still short\n- Increase seed count, minor hyperparam sweeps (learning_rate, num_leaves, spw).\n- Cost-sensitive tweaks (more extreme spw) or light oversampling for rare classes (careful with GroupKFold).\n- Longer-term: add audio features (MFCC/spectrogram) or deep models.\n\nRisks/monitoring\n- Watch train vs OOF AUC for overfit; prefer early stopping.\n- Target gates: LGBM alone ≥0.86 → add LR/XGB to clear 0.873+. Submit incrementally."

I need to pause and further adjust—maybe add `extra_trees=True` as a last resort or drop raw hist, keeping only SVD. I'm thinking about setting `boosting_type='gbdt'` explicitly and possibly making it deterministic. The key is that I have already disabled prefiltering. There are still no splits for the first class, although it does mention best_iter=1 for one class, which indicates some training, but it’s not progressing as expected.**Addressing training issues**\n\nThe training is using a logloss objective, but a gain of -inf suggests there might be numerical issues—possibly hessians are becoming zero due to extreme labels or saturated predictions. I plan to change the boosting to `extra_trees=True` to force random splits. I might reduce the feature set by removing raw histogram parts and keeping only SVD components and base features. After that, I need to interrupt, then edit cell 2 to reflect these changes and maybe tweak a few other parameters. It all feels a bit overwhelming, but I'm working through it!**Simplifying training adjustments**\n\nI’m thinking of simplifying the process by excluding the raw histogram. I would change `parts_tr` to just include `Xb_tr` and `st_tr_feat`, adding `Z_tr` only if needed. Next, I’ll set `extra_trees=True` and consider adjusting `max_bin` down to 64 instead of keeping it at 96. The plan is to interrupt the execution first, then edit those settings before running the code again since I can only handle one tool per turn.

    "llm_json": "**Implementing changes**\n\nI'm planning to modify the `parts_tr` by changing it to just include `[Xb_tr, st_tr_feat]` while excluding `H_tr`. The same changes will apply to `va` and `te`. I need to ensure that SVD components are still appended if they exist. I’ll also set `max_bin` to 64 instead of 96, enable `extra_trees=True`, and consider if I should add monotone constraints, though I think no. It might be useful to set `'deterministic': True` and `'force_row_wise': True`, and I'll maintain `force_col_wise=True`.

We have AUC logs for the folds, but the excessive logging is becoming an issue. I could adjust parameters or change to XGBoost to reduce logging, especially since early stopping conditions aren't showing improvement. It seems like LightGBM isn't able to split due to feature values being NaN or equal, which might indicate a need for different handling.**Considering model adjustments**\n\nI'm thinking about quickly testing a Logistic Regression baseline to compute Out-Of-Fold AUC, or perhaps using XGBoost with similar parameters. The immediate task was to adjust the parameters to be less restrictive, yet it’s still failing. I could reach out for expert advice again. Given our tool constraints, I can switch to scikit-learn's LogisticRegression with balanced class weights and standardized features, while imputing NaNs with a sentinel value. However, I need to be cautious with filling NaNs globally due to earlier warnings. Alternatively, I could implement a new model in cell 4.**Planning model training**\n\nI’m considering appending a new cell (index 4) to train XGBoost on the same matrices, using station priors, SVD, and maybe incorporating raw hist data. Although we removed raw hist earlier, I can include H_tr. I’ll need to ensure the XGB package is installed. I'll set up a code cell that builds features similarly and uses multi-label one-vs-rest with XGBClassifier, specifying parameters like max_depth, n_estimators, and learning rate. First, I need to interrupt the current execution in cell 2 before inserting the new cell.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"execute_notebook_code\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"code_execution_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"interrupt_execution\",\n    \"cell_index\": 2\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Interrupt LightGBM training still stuck with no positive-gain splits.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating model performance**\n\nWe definitely need to take action. I've been following the guidance to use request_expert_review at major checkpoints. Even after applying suggested parameters, many classes still show no splits, although some folds display an AUC of 0.97, which seems unreasonable. \n\nJust stumbling across OOF files earlier shows 0.60784 from a failed run, which isn't good at all. I’m considering using XGBoost or CatBoost instead of LightGBM since XGBoost handles sparse data better. Maybe switching the LightGBM boosting type could help too! However, the logs still indicate “No further splits.”**Adjusting model parameters**\n\nI'm thinking about adding a quick debug cell to compute feature variance in a fold to check for variability, although we're working with minimal content. The user requested JSON tool invocation, so I guess I should modify Cell 2 parameters by adding feature_pre_filter=False and potentially adjusting other settings.\n\nSince we ran into issues, I might try XGBoost instead. I want to create a new cell (index 4) to implement an XGBClassifier-based model with similar fold logic and features. I'll use very permissive parameters and log our progress as we go!**Implementing XGBoost**\n\nI think it's time to implement XGBoost. If it’s not installed, I’ll need to run `pip install xgboost`. I’ll save the output as `prod_xgb_oof.npy` and compute the macro AUC. There's also the possibility of writing a submission.\n\nAlright, let’s go ahead and insert that new cell to get everything set up!

But since the instructions are to use one tool per turn, it makes sense to reach out to an expert for advice first. I want to confirm if turning off the objective to \"xentropy\" is a good idea and inquire about using monotone constraints. Also, considering a simple logistic regression baseline on SVD hist seems practical. It’s time to request an expert review with detailed questions.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Status: After applying expert-advised fixes (feature_pre_filter=False, min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=1e-5, min_child_samples=1, constrained num_leaves/depth, coarser max_bin, force_col_wise=True), LightGBM still spams 'No further splits with positive gain, best gain: -inf' across many classes/folds. We also tried dropping raw histogram (kept base + station prior + SVD) and adding extra_trees=True; still no luck. LGBM OOF remains unusable. We implemented an XGBoost alternative (hist tree_method, scale_pos_weight, early stopping), but the saved OOF Macro AUC is 0.56827, which is far below expected and likely indicates a pipeline issue (possibly partial/incomplete training saving, or feature misalignment once we dropped raw histogram). Current files: prod_lgb_* from a stuck LGBM run; prod_xgb_* saved and evaluated at 0.56827; submission_prod_xgb.csv exists. Request: 1) Diagnose why LightGBM with feature_pre_filter=False still yields -inf gains on this small, imbalanced data (lgb v4.6.0). Are there additional parameters needed in v4 to prevent prefilter-like behavior (e.g., feature_fraction_bynode, deterministic, path_smooth, monotone_constraints default)? 2) Provide a known-good, minimal LGBM parameter set for small-N, many-NaN, highly imbalanced binary tasks that guarantees splits (e.g., exact params including extra_trees, max_cat_to_onehot, etc.). 3) For XGBoost, suggest a compact feature set order and parameters that have worked on MLSP 2013 tabular (e.g., use only station prior + 8\\u201316 SVD comps + a handful of dense engineered features), and confirm if we should avoid dropping raw histogram entirely. 4) Recommend immediate debugging checks: per-fold variance check of features after concatenation, proportion of NaNs, confirm station-prior calculation and no leakage, and ensure oof/test saving only after all classes/seeds complete. 5) Provide a concrete next-step plan to reach \\u22650.87 AUC quickly (e.g., revert to SVD-only + station priors logistic regression/XGB, then blend).\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**CRITICAL ISSUES**\n\n1.  **Feature Pipeline Regression:** Your primary error is dropping the raw histogram features. This is the main cause of the 0.568 XGBoost score and the LightGBM training failures. The bag-of-words histogram is the strongest signal in this dataset; SVD alone is insufficient. You are starving the models of information.\n2.  **Execution Integrity:** You are evaluating stale and incomplete results. The 0.607 LGBM OOF is from a previous run, and the 0.568 XGB OOF is likely an artifact of an interrupted execution. This masks the true impact of your pipeline changes.\n\n**ACTION PLAN**\n\n1.  **Correct Pipeline & Verify (1-2 Hours):**\n    *   Delete all saved `.npy` files to force a fresh computation.\n    *   In your feature concatenation logic, re-add the raw histogram matrices (`H_tr`, `H_va`, `H_test`). The final feature set should be `[Base Features + Station Prior + SVD Comps + Raw Histogram]`.\n    *   Run only the XGBoost model. The OOF AUC must jump from 0.568 to >0.85. If it does not, the feature fix is wrong. Do not proceed.\n\n2.  **Train Models (4-6 Hours):**\n    *   **LightGBM:** Use the corrected features and apply these parameters to ensure stable splits on imbalanced data: `feature_pre_filter=False`, `num_leaves=15`, `max_depth=4`, `min_child_samples=1`, `min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=1e-7`, `extra_trees=True`, `path_smooth=0.1`, `deterministic=True`, `min_data_in_bin=1`.\n    *   **XGBoost:** With corrected features, use parameters tuned for imbalance: `tree_method='hist'`, `max_depth=4`, `min_child_weight=0.01` (or lower), `eta=0.02`.\n    *   **Simple Baseline:** Train a `LogisticRegression(C=0.1)` on a minimal feature set of `[Station Prior + Top 16 SVD Components]`. This is a fast and powerful blend component.\n\n3.  **Blend for Submission (1 Hour):**\n    *   Create a simple 50/50 average of your LGBM and XGBoost OOF predictions.\n    *   Evaluate the blended OOF AUC. It should exceed the 0.87 bronze threshold.\n    *   Apply the same blend weights to your test predictions for submission.\n\n**ESSENTIAL DEBUGGING CHECKS**\n\n*   **File Hygiene:** Before running, delete old artifacts. After a full run, save results to a temporary file and rename only upon successful completion to prevent partial writes.\n*   **Feature Verification:** Inside the training loop, print `X_tr_mat.shape` to confirm the histogram features were added correctly.\n*   **Data Sanity:** Per fold, check for and remove any zero-variance or all-NaN columns before training.\n*   **Result Loading:** After loading saved OOF files, assert their shape is correct (e.g., `(n_train, 19)`) and check a checksum or mean/std to confirm you are evaluating the correct run.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: close the OOF↔LB gap, unblock LightGBM with less restrictive settings, add raw histogram bins, and ensemble with a simple LR. Target OOF ≥0.87 before submitting.\n\nWhat to fix first (debug the discrepancy):\n- Verify the 0.8404 submission came from the current pipeline (not an older notebook). Re-run that exact config to reproduce.\n- Audit OOF evaluation: ID alignment, GroupKFold by station, label order per class, and metric computation.\n- Sanity-check features for recordings with no segments (no global fillna; keep has_segments and engineered ratios intact).\n- Build a trivial baseline to validate pipeline: LogisticRegression on [raw histogram + station prior] with class_weight='balanced'. If OOF << LB, fix alignment/leakage before modeling.\n\nUnblock LightGBM (stronger single-model baseline):\n- Use one of these configs per class (keep min_child_samples=1, min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=1e-6, feature_pre_filter=False, force_col_wise=True, zero_as_missing=False):\n  - Option A (recommended first): boosting_type='goss', n_estimators=4000, learning_rate=0.05, num_leaves=127, max_depth=-1, max_bin=255, colsample_bytree=1.0, subsample=1.0, reg_alpha=0.0, reg_lambda=0.0, scale_pos_weight=min(100, spw). Early stopping: 50 rounds; log every 25.\n  - Option B (if stalls persist): boosting_type='gbdt', n_estimators=3000, learning_rate=0.07, num_leaves=127, max_depth=6 to -1, max_bin=255, subsample=0.9, colsample_bytree=0.9, reg_alpha=0.01, reg_lambda=0.1, scale_pos_weight=min(100, spw). Early stopping: 150–200; log every 100.\n- Remove extra_trees. If many “no positive gain” messages remain, switch between GOSS/GBDT as above.\n- Handle degeneracy: if a fold has pos==0 or neg==0, skip boosting and use station prior for that fold/class. Cap scale_pos_weight at 100.\n\nImprove features (small-data friendly):\n- Append raw histogram bins to the feature matrix (train/valid/test) alongside current engineered features (coverage_ratio, segment_density, freq_coverage, has_segments), station priors, and SVD-on-hist.\n- Keep GroupKFold by station and seed averaging.\n\nBuild a simple, diverse ensemble:\n- Train per-class LogisticRegression (liblinear or saga, class_weight='balanced', C tuned, max_iter=1000) on [raw hist + station prior (+ key engineered features)].\n- Optional: keep XGBoost if you can lift its OOF; otherwise deprioritize until LGBM/LR are solid.\n- Blend: average LGBM (goss) + LGBM (gbdt) + LR across 3 seeds; or stack their OOF with a light meta-learner (Ridge/LightGBM). Expect +0.02–0.05 AUC.\n\nOperational tips:\n- Measure and interrupt dead folds early; ensure per-class timing/logs.\n- Tune only a few knobs: learning_rate, num_leaves, spw cap, and inclusion of raw hist. Use a tiny grid/Optuna on OOF.\n- Submit only when OOF ≥0.87; double-check ID alignment in submission build."

    "llm_json": "**Implementing expert action plan**\n\nI need to delete saved npy files and re-add the raw histogram features for both LGBM and XGB feature concatenation, which we previously dropped. Then I’ll run just XGBoost to confirm that OOF > 0.85. Next, I’ll modify cell 4 to include concatenated raw histogram features and adjust parameters according to the expert's recommendations. It's important to delete old prod_xgb_*.npy files to avoid stale data, and I’ll also add printing X_tr_mat shapes for clarity.**Adjusting final model parameters**\n\nThe expert mentioned that the final set should include raw histogram features, which is great because SVD on those histograms is acceptable too. I should adjust the parameters, setting max_depth to 4, eta to 0.02, and maybe min_child_weight to 1e-3. Things like subsample, colsample, and scale_pos_weight should be considered. After training, I’ll save temporarily and print the shapes of the data. Before building oof_mean, I need to clear out any previously saved files from cell 5 to prevent stale evaluations.

    "llm_json": "**Identifying issues in model setup**\n\nI’m noticing some potential problems in my setup. The train and test masks are defined, with the train mask only considering known labels, which might pose an issue. The count of training samples (258) and test samples (64) raises some concerns. Also, my XGBoost parameters may be too restricted; the Out-Of-Fold score of 0.59 seems very low, which might hint at a bug. I see discrepancies in feature shapes too; the class 04 fold 1 has a warning with a valid AUC dropping significantly.**Investigating label mapping and folds**\n\nI'm questioning whether our label mapping could be incorrect. The label_map is built from a file that likely contains both train and test labels, and we skip any '?' entries. This could mean that unlabeled test rows won’t be included in the label_map. The training mask relies on fold==0 and known_mask. However, seeing that class 03 appears degenerate in all three folds suggests there may be no positives for that class. I'm expecting an Out-Of-Fold score over 0.85, which raises deeper concerns about class imbalance and its impact on our results.**Creating a sanity check with Logistic Regression**\n\nI'm thinking of setting up a quick sanity check using Logistic Regression on a combination of raw histogram data and station prior, with standardization and filling NaNs to zero. I remember that while tree models shouldn't use a global fill, Logistic Regression needs that. Experts suggested this as a debugging step. The plan is to compute per-fold AUC based on just the station prior and evaluate the macro AUC for a simple model. \n\nI’ll create a new cell to delete any previous prod_lr files and build the features accordingly while omitting certain data to avoid NaNs.**Preparing for Logistic Regression with NaN handling**\n\nFor my Logistic Regression model, I need to ensure that NaNs are managed properly. Since the histogram has no NaNs because it was normalized, and the station prior scalar is computed per fold, the input matrix (X) is dense. \n\nI’ll use StandardScaler along with Logistic Regression parameters like C=1.0 or 0.1, a maximum of 1000 iterations, and balanced class weights, opting for solvers like 'liblinear' or 'saga'. The goal is to evaluate the macro AUC and save the out-of-fold results. If the AUC is around 0.85, it indicates the pipeline is working well while suggesting the need for XGBoost tuning. \n\nI’ll implement everything in a new cell, keeping the GroupKFold consistent.

    "llm_json": "**Analyzing model performance**\n\nI’m planning to print the final macro AUC after the first seed to see how it looks, but I need to make some code changes first. I’ll add a quick diagnostic to compute the AUC for the station prior only baseline to ensure it yields around 0.7. Also, I’ll compute per-class AUC using just the station prior. However, I’m concerned about possible feature leakage and decode distributions. It might be helpful to get expert feedback on the current diagnostics as we move forward.**Clarifying model metrics**\n\nI’m considering that class IDs align with the species_list order. I think our histogram bins and features are okay, but I’m questioning if the macro AUC ignoring degenerate predictions is correct. It averages across classes with at least one positive in training, but many classes might be poorly predicted, pulling the average down. Our LR with histogram and prior achieved 0.646, indicating potential leakage. I wonder if the histogram parsing is wrong or if the number of bins is off compared to what's expected.**Identifying potential issues**\n\nI think I might have encountered a bug related to how we're mapping H_train and H_test. The method we're using skips the first column, which is the rec_id, but I wonder if we mis-specified the train/test split. Currently, train_mask uses fold==0 and a known_mask, while test_mask is just fold==1 without that mask. This might lead to reducing labeled training examples to 258, which doesn’t seem ideal. I’m also concerned that our LR score of 0.646 suggests our features might not be informative enough. Could there be a problem with how we're building Y_train?**Checking train split consistency**\n\nI'm considering that there might be unlabeled entries in the train split that result in an empty list, leading us to set a zero vector for y. I feel like it’s important to verify the correlation between histogram bins and labels to ensure accuracy, but time is a factor here. Since I have instructions to use the expert tool at checkpoints, I'll make sure to follow that guideline and check for any inconsistencies when I reach those points.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"We implemented your plan: restored RAW histogram into features, cleaned stale npy files, and re-ran XGBoost (hist tree, depth=4, eta=0.02, min_child_weight=1e-3, spw capped, 3 seeds). Despite many folds showing strong valid AUCs (e.g., 0.93\\u20130.97), the final macro OOF AUC remains very low: XGB 0.593, LR (station prior + RAW hist) 0.646. LightGBM still fails with -inf gain. This suggests a systemic issue beyond params. Current pipeline details: - Data: Using CVfolds_2.txt: train_mask = (fold==0 & labeled), test_mask = (fold==1). Labeled rec_ids=258, test=64. - Features: Base engineered (239 cols; NaNs preserved), station prior per fold, RAW histogram (101 bins; L1-normalized), optional per-fold SVD (<=12). - CV: GroupKFold(3) by station over training set. - IDs: prod_train_ids/prod_test_ids saved; H_train/H_test constructed by mapping rec_id->row index in histogram matrix. - OOF macro metric: macro_auc_ignoring_degenerate, averaging across classes with at least one positive in y_true. Evidence of correctness: We print per-fold shapes (e.g., (167,352)), station priors recomputed per fold, degenerate folds handled via constant preds. Hypotheses to review: 1) Hidden misalignment: class order vs species_list.txt; confirm that classes in rec_labels_test_hidden.txt labels match species_list order; any off-by-one? 2) Label-map construction: we treat empty label lists as all-zero; skip any line with '?'. Is that correct for this challenge? 3) Train/test split: Is (fold==0) the correct training subset? Should we instead train on all known labels (fold in {0,1} with labels known) and evaluate via GroupKFold only within known-labeled data, leaving provided fold for final submission only? 4) Histogram parsing: we L1-normalize rows; confirm this matches common practice. 5) Feature NaNs: could NaNs in base features be sabotaging linear/XGB performance (even though XGB handles NaNs)? Should we impute NaNs for XGB/LR while keeping NaNs for LGBM? 6) GroupKFold leakage/variance: stations may be highly stratified; but strong per-fold AUCs exist, yet macro average is low. Could macro averaging across many weak classes dominate due to extremely rare positives; what is a typical macro OOF for a simple hist+LR baseline in this dataset? Requested guidance: - Provide a minimal, known-good baseline for MLSP2013 with our split: exact features (RAW hist + station prior), CV (GroupKFold by station on fold==0 labeled), and expected macro OOF range. - Verify correct class index mapping for labels from rec_labels_test_hidden.txt relative to species_list.txt. - Advise whether to train on all labeled records (both folds with known labels) for OOF, and only use fold==1 for submission, to match typical MLSP setups. - If our parsing is correct, propose a compact XGB configuration that reliably yields >0.85 OOF here. - If an alignment bug is suspected, suggest a quick diagnostic (e.g., shuffle-control test: random permutation of labels should give ~0.5 AUC; or per-class check: compute AUC of station prior alone; or check that positives appear across folds). We will apply your exact fixes immediately.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "Your high per-fold AUCs (0.93-0.97) and low macro OOF AUC (0.593) confirm a fundamental pipeline bug, not a hyperparameter issue. The primary suspects are class index misalignment, incorrect training data usage, or OOF prediction/label row-order mismatch.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC & FIX PLAN**\n\n1.  **Establish a Minimal Known-Good Baseline (CRITICAL):**\n    The most efficient way to validate your entire pipeline (data split, labels, CV) is to run a simple model on a minimal feature set. Your current split (training on `fold==0`, testing on `fold==1`) is likely correct for this competition variant, but this test will confirm it.\n    *   **Action:** Run a Logistic Regression using only the raw histogram and a per-fold station prior.\n    *   **Expected OOF:** 0.70 - 0.78.\n    *   **If OOF < 0.68:** A severe bug exists. The most likely cause is that you are using the wrong training set, as noted in one audit. In this case, you must redefine your training set to include all labeled data not present in `CVfolds_2.txt`.\n    *   **If OOF > 0.70:** Your data split and label handling are likely correct. The low scores from complex models are due to feature/model issues.\n\n2.  **Run Explicit Alignment Assertions:**\n    Simultaneously, verify data integrity with these checks. An off-by-one error is a common cause of failure.\n    *   **Class Index Check:** Assert that parsed label IDs are 0-based and range from 0 to 18 (`num_classes-1`).\n    *   **OOF Row-Order Check:** After training, assert that the shape of your loaded OOF array matches the shape of your re-assembled `Y_eval` array. A mismatch here will silently corrupt your score.\n    *   **Shuffle Control Test:** Randomly shuffle your labels (`Y_eval`) before evaluation. The resulting macro AUC should be ~0.5. If not, your evaluation metric code is flawed.\n\n3.  **Fix LightGBM Training Failure:**\n    Your LightGBM model fails to find splits because it is not being fed the raw histogram features.\n    *   **Action:** In your feature preparation for LGBM, ensure you append the histogram matrix (`H_tr`) just as you do for XGBoost.\n\n**PATH TO A MEDAL SCORE (>0.87)**\n\nOnce the baseline OOF is >0.70, proceed with these model and feature improvements.\n\n1.  **Feature Strategy:**\n    *   Start all models with a minimal, high-signal feature set: `[station_prior + raw_histogram + SVD components (<=12)]`.\n    *   Your large block of 239 engineered `base_feats` is likely too noisy for the small dataset and is hurting performance. Add these back only after establishing a strong baseline, and impute NaNs (e.g., with per-fold median or -1) instead of relying on default model handling.\n\n2.  **Model Configurations:**\n    *   **XGBoost:** Use a robust configuration. Remove the cap on `scale_pos_weight` to properly weight rare classes.\n        ```python\n        params = {\n            'objective': 'binary:logistic', 'eval_metric': 'auc', 'max_depth': 4, 'eta': 0.02,\n            'subsample': 0.9, 'colsample_bytree': 0.8, 'min_child_weight': 1e-3,\n            'tree_method': 'hist', 'max_bin': 64, 'lambda': 0.1, 'scale_pos_weight': spw\n        }\n        # num_boost_round=6000, early_stopping_rounds=200\n        ```\n    *   **LightGBM:** After adding the histogram features, use parameters that force splits on sparse, imbalanced data.\n        ```python\n        params = {\n            'objective': 'binary', 'learning_rate': 0.03, 'num_leaves': 15, 'max_depth': 4,\n            'min_child_samples': 1, 'min_data_in_bin': 1, 'min_sum_hessian_in_leaf': 1e-7,\n            'extra_trees': True, 'path_smooth': 0.1, 'feature_pre_filter': False\n        }\n        ```\n\n3.  **Submission:**\n    *   With these fixes, XGBoost and LightGBM OOF should exceed 0.85.\n    *   An equal-weight average of your fixed LR, XGB, and LGBM models should be sufficient to surpass the 0.87 bronze medal threshold.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: tighten validation, unblock LightGBM, use full signal (raw histograms + SVD), then blend for the final lift.\n\nConcise plan\n- Status and target\n  - Current LB: 0.8404; Bronze: 0.8737.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating training set definitions**\n\nI'm considering how to actually move toward a better ranking. The user expert mentions we might want to use all labeled data for training instead of just the fold==0. So, instead of using fold==0 for training, we could try using the known_mask as the training pool and testing with fold==1. But I'm concerned about possible label leakage. The expected outcome based on expert opinion is around 0.70-0.78, but our result was 0.646. Maybe something’s wrong with our approach?**Analyzing histogram and metrics**\n\nI'm checking the histogram bins length and notice that the printed histogram matrix is (322, 101). H_train uses values from index 1 onward, which should give length 100. But, the log states \"RAW histogram bins (101 dims),\" which seems off since it's actually 100 dims. That might be a minor alignment issue. \n\nAlso, the Macro AUC overall ignores some classes with few positives. I'm still expected to see around 0.7 based on known baselines. I plan to implement diagnostics to double-check all this, compute prevalence, and create a new cell for diagnostics.**Setting up checks for metrics**\n\nI need to assert that labels range from 0 to num_classes - 1, so I'll gather that from the label_map. \n\nNext, I’ll build Y_train and check the sums per class, printing the positives for each class and per fold using Group K-Fold (gkf). \n\nI’ll also compute the macro AUC on out-of-fold (oof) predictions from station prior versus Y_train, then randomly permute Y_train rows to compute macro AUC again.

    "llm_json": "**Clarifying cross-validation folds**\n\nI'm considering how we’re using 'fold==0' and its relevance, as CVfolds_2 likely assigns fold numbers just for training splits. It seems that in MLSP, folds 0 and 1 are both used for cross-validation, and the test set is hidden. I think the competition setup expects training on fold == 0 and predicting with fold == 1 for leaderboard purposes. I notice we have some labeled data for fold == 1, but it also shows 64 unlabeled entries consistent with my findings.**Analyzing model features**\n\nI'm pondering why the station prior is only 0.304, which is below the random threshold of 0.5, suggesting it might be too constant and that some classes are extremely rare. AUC values can even drop below 0.5. I think we should follow the Action Plan by moving to minimal features for our models like station prior, raw history, and SVD, while removing base engineered features during training for XGB and LGBM. The expert mentioned that the base features are too noisy, so I'll remove them and look for improvement in out-of-fold metrics.**Updating XGB parameters**\n\nI want to modify the XGB settings by dropping the X_base features and keeping the station prior, raw history, and SVD. I also plan to remove the cap on scale_pos_weight and reduce colsample_bytree to 0.8. Once I make these changes, I’ll re-run cell 4, but I know it will take some time. I need to reassess the logistic regression baseline as well, since we previously got only 0.646 when the expert expected 0.70-0.78. So, it seems like some adjustments to XGB features are necessary.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 4,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Strong single model (alternative): XGBoost with GroupKFold, station priors + SVD + RAW HIST, 3-seed averaging\",\n      \"import sys, subprocess, time, os\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"try:\",\n      \"    import xgboost as xgb\",\n      \"except Exception:\",\n      \"    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', 'xgboost'])\",\n      \"    import xgboost as xgb\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('Starting XGBoost training... xgb version:', getattr(xgb, '__version__', 'unknown'))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Clean stale artifacts BEFORE training to avoid evaluating partial runs\",\n      \"for fn in ['prod_xgb_oof.npy','prod_xgb_test.npy','prod_xgb_train_ids.npy','prod_xgb_test_ids.npy']:\",\n      \"    fp = Path(fn)\",\n      \"    if fp.exists():\",\n      \"        try: fp.unlink()\",\n      \"        except Exception as e: print('Could not delete', fn, e)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"X_base_df = pd.DataFrame(X_base, columns=feat_cols)\",\n      \"X_test_df = pd.DataFrame(X_test_base, columns=feat_cols)\",\n      \"X_base_mat = X_base_df.to_numpy(np.float32)\",\n      \"X_test_mat = X_test_df.to_numpy(np.float32)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"gkf = GroupKFold(n_splits=3)\",\n      \"n_train = X_base_df.shape[0]\",\n      \"n_test = X_test_df.shape[0]\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def run_seed_xgb(seed):\",\n      \"    oof = np.zeros((n_train, num_classes), dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"    te = np.zeros((n_test, num_classes), dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"    for c in range(num_classes):\",\n      \"        y = Y_train[:, c].astype(int)\",\n      \"        cls_oof = np.zeros(n_train, dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"        cls_te_acc = np.zeros(n_test, dtype=np.float32)\",\n      \"        fold_no = 0\",\n      \"        for tr_idx, va_idx in gkf.split(X_base_df, y, groups):\",\n      \"            fold_no += 1\",\n      \"            tstart = time.time()\",\n      \"            # Base dropped per expert advice;

    "llm_json": "**Deciding Next Steps**\n\nI need to determine our next actions. It looks like the XGB modified cell ran partially, with artifacts from 02:22:05 suggesting the old evaluation showed an AUC of 0.59338. However, that conflicts with earlier data at 02:14. The diagnostics indicate a prior AUC of 0.304. In Cell 4, the current code drops X_base and uses other features. The partial logs show 113 features, which seems correct, but despite the updated code, the macro AUC is still at 0.59338, indicating a persistent alignment bug. I should request an expert review soon.**Requesting Expert Review**\n\nI think we should request an expert review now since the pipeline performance is still low after excluding base features. I need them to diagnose potential issues like label leakage, group mismatches, or histogram alignment. The station prior performance is poor, possibly due to group mismatches between the training and validation sets. If we computed station priors from train data only, that’s alright, but the baseline yielding 0.304 is concerning. I wonder if there might be label misalignment as well. We used a filtering mechanism for the labels, and we need to ensure everything aligns correctly.**Analyzing Station Prior Issues**\n\nI’m considering that the test's prior computing uses unseen stations, which might be okay, but the station prior showing only an AUC of 0.304 is concerning — that’s worse than random. This could mean the 'station' field isn’t what I think it is, or maybe there’s a mismatch with the groups used in GroupKFold. It’s meant to prevent leakage, but the observation raises doubts. The splits in CVfolds_2 could suggest a correspondence to time or location. The low AUC might imply an anti-correlation, so I’ll need to check how the mapping functions used string stations from the test or validation sets.**Requesting Expert Review**\n\nI’m considering another angle regarding the macro AUC calculation. The `macro_auc_ignoring_degenerate` function compares OOF predictions against true labels aligned to `rec_train`. I need to ensure that the OOF is properly aligned. The station prior OOF fills `cls_oof[va]` based on indices from `gkf.split(X_base, y, groups)`, which should be consistent. However, the AUC of 0.304 suggests possible sign inversion. I think I misinterpreted the label encoding, so I’ll request an expert review, outlining our findings and asking them to inspect for alignment bugs.**Requesting Concrete Steps for Validation**\n\nI think I should ask for specific steps to validate our findings. This could include running a quick permutation test, creating a per-station prevalence sanity list, computing the AUC of histogram-only logistic regression with shuffling control, and checking the distribution of GroupKFold groups across folds. I wonder if the station strings should really just be the first four letters. Also, many features may be NaN; I remember XGB struggles with NaN values, but we didn't use `X_base`, and the histogram has no NaN, which is good. It’s time to request an expert review.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Major checkpoint: We executed the key experiment\\u2014XGBoost using only [station_prior + SVD_on_hist + raw_histogram], dropping the 239 base engineered features. Artifacts saved at 02:22:05; evaluation (Cell 5) gives prod_xgb OOF Macro AUC = 0.59338. Diagnostics show station-prior-only OOF Macro AUC = 0.30427 (worse than random). LR baseline on [station_prior + raw_hist] is 0.64642. LightGBM still shows the 'No further splits with positive gain' issue and macro AUC ~0.60784. This suggests a deeper alignment bug persists.\\n\\nRequest: Please audit Cells 1, 4, 6, and 7 for likely systemic misalignment sources. Specific questions:\\n1) Station parsing/grouping: We derive station as filename.split('_')[0] (e.g., 'PC10'). Is this the correct grouping key? Could station strings be mismatched between rec_id mapping and CV folds? Should we instead group by the site code present elsewhere?\\n2) Label parsing: We read rec_labels_test_hidden.txt, skip '?' entries per line, and build per-rec one-hot with 19 classes (indices 0..18). Is this correct? Could misinterpretation of '?' or empty labels cause silent errors? Any known quirks for this file?\\n3) Histogram alignment: We map rec_id to hist row via a dict built from histogram_of_segments.txt. Any known gotchas\\u2014duplicate rec_ids, missing rows, or header offsets? Our hist_df shows shape (322, 101) with 100 bins plus rec_id column; L1 normalization applied. Does this match expectations?\\n4) CV strategy: Using GroupKFold(3) with groups=station, and fold-level priors computed on train folds only. Station-prior-only OOF AUC = 0.304 suggests anti-correlation. Could we be leaking inverted mapping across folds, or should priors be computed differently?\\n5) Feature construction: For XGB run, we used ONLY [station_prior (1d) + per-fold SVD on RAW histogram (<=12 comps) + RAW histogram (100 bins)], no base features or NaNs involved. Any recommendations on alternative minimal feature that should yield >0.70 OOF if aligned (e.g., hist-only LR/XGB with specific preprocessing)?\\n\\nWhat concrete sanity checks would you run next to pinpoint the misalignment? Examples we can add right away: (a) per-station prevalence vs OOF AUC by class; (b) verify that for a random fold, the validation station priors correlate positively with labels; (c) AUC on hist-only LR with z-scoring; (d) recompute station from rec_id mapping using regex; (e) rebuild ID orders to ensure Y_train aligns with feature matrices. Please advise priority steps to quickly lift OOF to >0.70 and get us on medal track.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Diagnosis**\n\nThe catastrophic OOF AUC of 0.304 confirms a critical data alignment bug, not a modeling issue. Your features and labels are anti-correlated. Two specific bugs are the likely cause:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Label Parsing (Primary Cause):** Your code incorrectly discards entire records containing a '?' token (`if any('?'...): continue`). The correct behavior is to process the record but ignore only the '?' tokens, not the entire line. This error systematically prunes labeled data in a station-dependent way, inverting the calculated station prevalence and causing the anti-correlation.\n2.  **Fragile Data Pipeline & Feature Corruption:**\n    *   Building numpy arrays from multiple, separately filtered DataFrames is prone to silent re-indexing errors, misaligning `groups`, `Y_train`, and `H_train`.\n    *   The histogram file (`histogram_of_segments.txt`) contains duplicate `rec_id`s. Your current parsing logic silently overwrites earlier entries with later ones, corrupting histogram features for those records.\n\n**Action Plan (Execute in Order)**\n\n1.  **Fix Label Parsing:** Modify your label reading logic to process every line with a valid `rec_id`. Inside the token loop, skip only the tokens that are '?' or blank, but build the label vector from all valid class IDs on that line.\n2.  **Implement a Robust Data Pipeline:** Refactor your data preparation to use a single, unified `master_df`.\n    *   Start with the `cv_df` to lock down row order.\n    *   Merge metadata (`rec_map`), base features (`gb`), and histogram data onto this `master_df`.\n    *   **Fix Histogram Duplicates:** Before merging, aggregate the histogram data: `hist_df = hist_df.groupby('rec_id').mean().reset_index()`.\n    *   Generate and join label columns to the `master_df` using the corrected `label_map`.\n    *   Extract all final numpy arrays (`Y_train`, `groups`, `H_train`, etc.) from this single, aligned DataFrame.\n3.  **Strengthen Parsing and Add Assertions:**\n    *   Use a robust regex for station parsing, e.g., `df['filename'].str.extract(r'^([A-Z0-9]+)_')`, instead of a fragile `.split('_')`.\n    *   Add assertions to your code to verify alignment, e.g., `assert np.array_equal(groups, train_df['station'].values)`. Verify unique IDs and full data coverage between sources.\n\n**Validation Plan**\n\nDo not proceed to model tuning until these checks pass.\n\n1.  **Re-run Station Prior Diagnostic:** After applying the fixes, the `station-prior-only OOF AUC` must be >0.70.\n2.  **Run a Minimal Baseline:** A Logistic Regression on z-scored histogram features (without station priors) should now achieve an OOF AUC >0.70.\n3.  **Re-run XGBoost:** Your minimal XGBoost experiment (`station_prior + SVD_on_hist + raw_histogram`) should now score >0.80 OOF.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Fix alignment bug, then lean on minimal features + blending to clear 0.87372.\n\nStatus\n- Current LB 0.8404 < bronze 0.87372. OOFs 0.59–0.65; station-prior AUC 0.304 (sub-random) = pipeline bug.\n- Goal: after fix, reach OOF ≥0.85 and LB ≥0.87372 via minimal features + blending.\n\nImmediate priority: fix the core bug (alignment/station prior)\n- Verify strict ID alignment across all data:\n  - Use merges, not index mapping: join on rec_id for labels, histograms, segments; assert no missing/misaligned keys.\n  - Add assertions: all train/test rec_ids exist in label map and histogram rows; shapes consistent per fold.\n- Recompute/validate station parsing:\n  - Ensure station is extracted correctly from filenames; print spot checks.\n- Sanity checks after each change:\n  - Re-run “station-prior-only” baseline; expect AUC ~0.6–0.8. If <0.5, bug persists.\n  - Confirm CV grouping by station; print station distribution per fold; ensure no leakage or empty-class folds.\n  - Inspect a few rec_ids end-to-end: label vector, station, histogram row, and prediction align.\n\nModeling plan once fixed\n- Use minimal, reliable features everywhere: [station_prior + SVD_on_hist + raw_hist] (drop the 239 base features initially).\n- SVD: n_components 16–24; L1-normalize hist before SVD; fit SVD per fold.\n- Train three models on the same features:\n  - XGBoost/LightGBM: eta 0.01–0.05, 2–8k rounds with early stopping; no hard cap on scale_pos_weight; monitor overfit.\n  - Logistic Regression (L2) as a stable linear baseline.\n- Blend:\n  - 3–5 seeds per model; per-class mean ensemble of LR + XGB + LGB.\n  - Keep raw histogram features in stacks; simple averaging often suffices.\n- Targets: OOF ≥0.75 immediately after fix; iterate to ≥0.85 with tuning/blending.\n\nCV and diagnostics\n- Primary: GroupKFold by station; consider 5 folds or repeated GroupKFold if station counts allow.\n- For debugging only: quick KFold to confirm features carry signal (don’t use for final).\n- Handle degenerate classes (continue ignoring in macro AUC as you do).\n\nSubmission strategy\n- If minimal-feature OOF ≥0.70, submit to verify LB lift; expect substantial jump vs 0.8404.\n- Add seeds/components and blends to push past 0.87372; submit frequently to confirm gains.\n- After stable bronze-level OOF, cautiously reintroduce a small subset of high-signal base features (guided by importance), and/or increase SVD components.\n\nExpected path to bronze\n- Fix alignment → station-prior AUC ~0.6–0.8 → minimal-feature models OOF ≥0.75 → blend/tune to OOF ≥0.85 → LB ≥0.87372."

First, I should adjust label parsing so it only skips tokens with '?', not the whole line. I also need to deduplicate the histogram by grouping by mean through `rec_id` and unify the merges with `master_df`. The current label parsing logic is flawed and requires fixing. Additionally, I'll implement regex for station parsing, which should improve overall accuracy.**Modifying code block**\n\nI’m planning to modify that code block. First, I need to change label parsing so it processes all tokens but skips only the '?' tokens. After building `hist_df`, I’ll deduplicate it by averaging with `groupby('rec_id', as_index=False)`. For station parsing, I'll use regex to extract the required pattern. I must ensure that merging with `master_df` happens correctly and that `hist` mapping uses the deduplicated `hist_df`. I'll also add assertions to verify mappings for all `rec_train/test` and print duplicates count. Finally, I’ll confirm that arrays are rebuilt based on the `master_df` order.**Crafting modifications**\n\nI’m preparing some modifications! First, I'll change the `rec_map['station']` line to use extract so that it pulls from `filename` properly. I want to remove the entire-line skip in label parsing and focus on handling individual tokens. After building `hist_df`, I’ll calculate the mean and print duplicates count. Additionally, after creating `H_train/H_test`, I’ll add an assertion to confirm that all rec_ids have a corresponding hist present. I'll align segment counts from the groupby operation, then update Cell 1's entire content with these changes. After that, we can execute it next turn!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 1,\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Setup, data parsing, and helpers (strict ID alignment ready)\",\n      \"import os, sys, time, glob, re, math, json, gc\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"from sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD\",\n      \"\",\n      \"t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"BASE = Path.cwd()\",\n      \"print('CWD:', BASE)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# 1) Load core metadata\",\n      \"sp_path = BASE/'essential_data'/'species_list.txt'\",\n      \"cv_path = BASE/'essential_data'/'CVfolds_2.txt'\",\n      \"map_path = BASE/'essential_data'/'rec_id2filename.txt'\",\n      \"lab_path = BASE/'essential_data'/'rec_labels_test_hidden.txt'\",\n      \"hos_path = BASE/'supplemental_data'/'histogram_of_segments.txt'\",\n      \"segf_path = BASE/'supplemental_data'/'segment_features.txt'\",\n      \"segr_path = BASE/'supplemental_data'/'segment_rectangles.txt'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"sp_df = pd.read_csv(sp_path)\",\n      \"num_classes = int(sp_df.shape[0])\",\n      \"cv_df = pd.read_csv(cv_path)\",\n      \"rec_map = pd.read_csv(map_path)\",\n      \"# Robust station parsing via regex\",\n      \"rec_map['station'] = rec_map['filename'].astype(str).str.extract(r'^([A-Z0-9]+)_', expand=False).fillna('UNK')\",\n      \"meta = cv_df.merge(rec_map, on='rec_id', how='left')\",\n      \"print('Species:', num_classes, '| meta shape:', meta.shape)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# 2) Parse labels with all-negative allowed;

    "llm_json": "**Analyzing AUC diagnostics**\n\nI’m noticing that the diagnostics are still showing an AUC of 0.304 despite a label parsing fix, which makes me question if the diagnostic cell is using outdated variables. Y_train was rebuilt, but I'm still seeing the unchanged AUC. It could be that our groups in GroupKFold are mismatched with feat_df order or Y_train. Some folds show zero valid positives, which is okay for certain classes. However, a 0.304 AUC for station priors feels very low, so maybe there's an issue with the regex for station extraction.**Examining filename regex and diagnostics**\n\nI see that the regex for filenames like PC10_20090513_054500_0020.wav successfully captures 'PC10,' which is great. There's a hypothesis suggesting that prior issues stemmed from discarding lines with '?', but even after fixing that, diagnostics show labeled rec_ids at 322. This implies that labels for hidden test records might exist. I'm also wondering if rec_labels_test_hidden mixes train and test labels. We assigned zero vectors, but it seems if records had only '?', Y becomes all zeros, which is intended. Still, the AUC hasn't improved post-fix, so maybe Cell 7 is using cached groups.**Investigating station prior construction**\n\nI think the issue might be in how we're constructing station priors. We're using the groups variable for train stations, but in station_prior_oof, they call gkf.split(X_base, y, groups), where X_base has many NaNs. The GroupKFold split only uses groups and y, which makes me wonder if the mapping of station priors could lead to anti-correlation. It’s also possible that the Y_train order isn't properly aligned with groups. We built Y_train from label_map[rec_train], which should align if rec_train length matches known_mask and fold==0 condition.**Analyzing label_map and AUC issues**\n\nI see that label_map has a length of 322, indicating all records are considered labeled, including test records. The masks align correctly, with train_mask having 258 and test_mask 64. However, the station-prior AUC of 0.304 may suggest an inversion issue. I’m questioning if we might be using incorrect fold definitions. GroupKFold seems to split stations arbitrarily, which could lead to anti-correlated predictions if we computed priors on the wrong subset. It appears the code is fine, but the unchanged AUC suggests the label parsing change may not have significantly altered Y_train content.**Debugging labeled rec_ids and station prior**\n\nI noticed that the diagnostics indicate \"Labeled rec_ids: 322.\" I’m unsure if this is an increase from the previous count, which might have been 258. Because of this uncertainty, I think it’s a good idea to add a focused debugging print to compute per-station prevalence in the full training set and examine the correlation between station prior and actual labels. We should also print the macro AUC for the histogram-only logistic regression, but our previous baseline was 0.646, still low. \n\nNext, I’ll recompute the station prior using a global mapping and evaluate the AUC. If it’s still low or below 0.5, it suggests a possible mismatch in station extraction or labels. I plan to add a new diagnostic cell at index 8 for these computations, focusing on mapping station prevalence and estimating the AUC.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 8,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Extra diagnostics: station prevalence sanity checks\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('=== EXTRA DIAGNOSTICS: Station prevalence sanity ===')\",\n      \"stations_tr = groups  # aligned with Y_train/rec_train\",\n      \"assert len(stations_tr) == Y_train.shape[0], 'stations_tr misaligned with Y_train'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def auc_ignore_deg(y, p):\",\n      \"    if y.sum()==0 or y.sum()==y.shape[0]:\",\n      \"        return np.nan\",\n      \"    return roc_auc_score(y, p)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# 1) Global (leaky) per-station prevalence AUC on same data.

    "llm_json": "**Analyzing AUC calculations**\n\nI think the right approach is to compute priors at the station prefix group level instead of focusing on exact stations. Using GroupKFold prevents leaking between stations, but the usual station prior feature uses training estimates, which might not work well for unseen validation stations. They default to the global mean, leading to a lack of variation, which can degenerate the AUC to around 0.5. Yet, we see an AUC of 0.304, which raises questions about handling. Something seems off here.**Examining validation predictions**\n\nIn my analysis of station_prior_oof, I realized that for unseen stations in validation, they rely on st_prior.get(s, gm). But with GroupKFold splitting by station, all validation stations remain unseen in the training fold, leading to constant predictions since gm is returned for all rows. This could cause a degenerate class scenario, which might average to 0.5. However, I'm seeing a macro AUC of 0.304 instead. I wonder if they're not effectively using GroupKFold by station, and that might be why it’s falling short.**Investigating AUC discrepancies**\n\nI'm considering whether the global mean (gm) might vary per fold and across validation samples due to how station mapping defaults to gm based on training prevalence. Since gm is a scalar, all validation samples would receive the same probability within a fold, leading to an expected AUC of 0.5. Yet, the observed 0.304 suggests something else is amiss. The diagnostics indicate consistency, but perhaps the GroupKFold isn't correctly aligned with the station groups. If the groups don't truly represent the stations, that could explain the issue.**Assessing class predictions and AUC**\n\nI'm realizing that the validation fold can contain multiple stations, but since the training folds have no overlapping stations, the mapping for validation stations defaults to a constant global mean (gm). This results in constant predictions within each fold. Since gm varies across folds and classes, this could cause anti-correlation issues, leading to a macro AUC significantly below 0.5. To address this, I can't use station priors with GroupKFold grouped by station, as it creates inherent leakage and becomes non-informative otherwise.**Evaluating station priors**\n\nI’m thinking the typical method is to compute priors at a higher level, like by station family or region, instead of using GroupKFold. While I could use KFold without groups and include station prior, that could introduce leakage since the same station might show up in both training and validation, resulting in an overly optimistic AUC. It's tricky because while global station prior is okay, I need to ensure I'm not leaking information across folds.

    "llm_json": "**Examining GroupKFold leakage**\n\nI've realized that GroupKFold splits by station, which can lead to data leakage because global priors include validation stations. This might inflate OOF scores but could improve LB results. Still, we need to avoid leaky evaluations. A better approach would be to create distinct station family groups to prevent leakage while keeping GroupKFold by station. If validation stations appear in the priors map, it creates inconsistencies. I wonder if using station priors from the full training set for the medal is acceptable since the test dataset likely overlaps with the same stations.**Evaluating CV folds and priors**\n\nI’m considering how CV folds defined by time segments can lead to the same stations appearing in both train and test folds. Using station priors seems acceptable for internal cross-validation in the competition, though there’s some risk involved. An alternative would be to compute priors at the regional level, using station prefixes like 'PC' and unique digits. I wonder if we should also leverage global station prior features for model adaptation. If I reshape the station prior feature for each class, I can integrate that into both LR and XGB models. I'll have to be cautious of potential leakage, but it’s worth aiming for the medal.**Implementing a new training cell**\n\nI’m planning to create a new cell for training XGB with a hist-only approach along with the global station prior. The simplest way would be to modify Cell 4 to use the global prior instead of the per-fold prior, but since that has already been executed, I think adding a new Cell 11 for XGB makes more sense. I’ll ensure the ST_PRIOR arrays exist and then implement the new features using the global prior. Even though this could lead to leaky OOF, our aim is to generate accurate test predictions and evaluate our OOF for submission.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating model strategies**\n\nI see they already provided a plan, but I'm thinking of additional ideas, like using a spectrogram CNN, though it might be heavy. I should consider increasing SVD components and including both SVD and raw histogram. It could be worthwhile to calibrate logistic regression with class_weight and C, and even explore elastic net. There’s non-linear models like CatBoost to consider, too. I wonder if engineered features might help add some signal since the earlier ones weren't effective. Maybe we could explore tabular models on limited hist data.**Preparing submission details**\n\nI should submit submission_prod_xgbG.csv to check the leaderboard. The interface uses submit_final_answer, which grades based on the official test set and will look for a file named submission.csv in the current working directory. So I need to rename my best submission file accordingly. I doubt my score will earn a medal. I plan to improve my models, trying XGB with only hist and adjusting parameters. Also, using k-fold without grouping might exploit station correlation but could lead to overfitting. There’s a crucial fix needed regarding station-prior predictions to ensure accurate AUC.**Implementing stronger models**\n\nI think it's time to move forward with a more robust model using XGB on the raw histogram data and SVD, maybe considering calibrated Platt scaling, though that might not be essential. I could also try Linear SVC per class with probability through CalibratedClassifierCV, which might yield better results. Following the workflow, it's a good checkpoint to involve expert review since we've applied substantial fixes yet still haven't hit our target. I’ll request guidance on features and check the expected OOF values along with details about normalizing and parsing histogram data.**Improving data parsing and scaling**\n\nI'm realizing that our parsing splits on commas, so I should check if the header includes at least 1+100 columns. We might also need to z-score the histogram features within the fold. For logistic regression, we used StandardScaler after optional SVD, but it still only got a score of 0.621. Maybe trying k-NN could be worthwhile? It seems like a good moment to request expert review on this to get some solid insights.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Major checkpoint: We fixed critical parsing/alignment bugs (labels now skip only '?', histogram dedup by rec_id mean, unified master_df order, regex station parsing, strict ID assertions). Results after fixes:\\n- Station-prevalence extra diag: Global (leaky) AUC=0.8649, but non-leaky GroupKFold-by-station prior AUC stays 0.304 (explained by unseen stations per fold -> near-constant preds per fold).\\n- LR histogram-only (with per-fold SVD+scaling, GroupKFold by station) OOF Macro AUC=0.6212.\\n- XGB minimal (hist+SVD, no base block, per-fold prior feature included but mostly constant) OOF=0.6145.\\n- XGB with GLOBAL (leaky) station prior + hist (+SVD) OOF=0.6311 and submission_prod_xgbG.csv produced.\\nWe expected >0.70 after bug fixes, but we're still in the low 0.62\\u20130.63 range.\\n\\nRequest guidance to reach medal:\\n1) Histogram parsing sanity: We read histogram_of_segments.txt into variable-length rows, pad to max len, then L1-normalize each row; dedup by groupby('rec_id').mean(). Current shape is (322, 101) -> 100 bins. Any known issues with bin order or header offset in this dataset that could crush performance if misread? Should we drop the first/last bin, or apply log1p/TF-IDF style scaling instead of L1?\\n2) CV choice: Using GroupKFold by station as primary CV per challenge protocol. Given station drift, should we add time-aware grouping or 5-fold GKF to stabilize? Would repeated GKF help? Any recommended group granularity (e.g., station families) that yields stronger non-leaky priors/features?\\n3) Feature set: Minimal hist-only is underperforming. Which small, high-signal engineered features from segment_rectangles should we reliably include without NaN pitfalls? (e.g., segment_count_total, duration_mean, freq_span_mean, area_tf_mean, coverage_ratio). Any must-have transforms (logs, clipping) that historically give a big boost here?\\n4) Modeling: For hist-only, what baseline hyperparams typically reach 0.70\\u20130.78 OOF under station GKF? (LR C, penalty; XGB depth/eta/rounds; LGBM settings). Should we standardize hist (z-score) before LR without SVD, or use higher SVD dims (32\\u201348)? Should we ensemble LR+XGB on hist-only first?\\n5) Station priors: Since per-fold station priors are non-informative under station-based GKF, do you recommend replacing them with coarser priors (e.g., partial station prefixes, time-of-day bins) that exist in both train and val folds? If yes, what exact definition works in MLSP 2013 without leakage?\\n6) Quick win suggestions to lift OOF from ~0.62 to >0.75 fast, under correct GKF by station: concrete steps and settings we can implement next.\\nWe\\u2019ll implement your prioritized checklist immediately and re-run OOF, then iterate to blending for LB \\u2265 0.873.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Diagnosis**\nYour data alignment and parsing fixes are correct. The core issue is your cross-validation strategy (`GroupKFold` by station) correctly identifies that station-based priors are useless for predicting on unseen stations, causing your non-leaky Out-of-Fold (OOF) score to be stuck at ~0.63. The high leaky global prior AUC (0.865) confirms the signal is strong, but your validation prevents its use. The performance gap is due to suboptimal histogram processing and a lack of other feature types.\n\n**Action Plan**\n\n**1. Cross-Validation Strategy (Choose One Path)**\n*   **Path A (Protocol-Correct):** Stick with `GroupKFold` by station. This is the most robust, non-leaky approach. To mitigate instability from small folds, switch to `RepeatedGroupKFold(n_splits=3, n_repeats=3-5)`. All subsequent OOF scores should be based on this.\n*   **Path B (Leaderboard Probe):** Switch to `StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)`. This is a high-risk, high-reward bet that the test set contains stations seen in training. It will allow your station priors to work, likely boosting OOF score significantly (>0.80), but this score may not be reliable.\n\n**2. Feature Processing & Engineering (Highest Priority)**\n*   **Histogram Transformation:** Your current histogram processing is insufficient.\n    *   **Primary Fix:** Apply a Hellinger transform: `H_transformed = np.sqrt(H / H.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True))`. This is superior to `log1p` for this data type.\n    *   **For Linear Models (LR):** Apply per-fold z-scoring (`StandardScaler`) to `H_transformed`.\n    *   **For Tree Models (XGB/LGBM):** Use `H_transformed` directly.\n    *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** After transformation, you can use SVD (32-48 components) or use the full 100 bins. Test both.\n*   **Curated Engineered Features:** Add back a small, robust set of features from `segment_rectangles`. Do not add all 239.\n    *   **Core Set:** `segment_count_total`, `coverage_ratio`, `duration_mean`, `area_tf_mean`, `freq_span_mean`, `freq_coverage`.\n    *   **Transforms:** Apply `np.log1p` to counts, durations, and areas. Clip outliers at the 99th percentile. Impute NaNs with the per-fold median or -1.\n*   **Non-Leaky Priors:** Since station priors are invalid under `GroupKFold`, create temporal priors from filename metadata.\n    *   Extract hour-of-day and month. Bin the hour (e.g., dawn, day, dusk, night).\n    *   In each fold, compute the target prevalence for these temporal bins (using Bayesian smoothing) and add them as features.\n\n**3. Modeling & Ensembling**\n*   **Feature Set:** For non-leaky models, use `[transformed_hist + SVD_hist + curated_rect_feats + temporal_priors]`. **Remove the station-based prior.**\n*   **Logistic Regression:** Use `C=0.5-1.0`, `penalty='l2'`, `class_weight='balanced'`, `solver='liblinear'`, `max_iter=2000`. Target OOF: 0.70-0.75 on transformed features.\n*   **XGBoost / LightGBM:** Use robust hyperparameters: `max_depth=3-5`, `learning_rate=0.02-0.03`, `n_estimators=6000` with early stopping, `subsample=0.8-0.9`, `colsample_bytree=0.7-0.8`, and `scale_pos_weight` (or `is_unbalance=True` for LGBM). For LGBM, add `extra_trees=True`. Target OOF: 0.75-0.80.\n*   **Ensembling:** Create a final submission by averaging the predictions of your best LR, XGB, and LGBM models.\n\n**Prioritized Checklist**\n1.  **Immediate Submission:** Submit your current model with the leaky global prior (0.631 OOF). It may score >0.85 on the leaderboard.\n2.  **Fix Histogram:** Apply the Hellinger transform. Re-run LR on histograms only. **Target OOF: >0.70.**\n3.  **Add Curated Features:** Add the 5-7 recommended `segment_rectangles` features with `log1p` transforms. **Target OOF: >0.75.**\n4.  **Tune & Blend:** Train optimized XGB and LGBM models on the full feature set. Blend with LR. **Target OOF: >0.78.**\n5.  **Stabilize:** Run the final blend using `RepeatedGroupKFold` for a reliable score.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Close a ~0.033 AUC gap by fixing the core data bug, using global station priors, dropping noisy base features, and blending simple models.\n\nStatus\n- Not on track: LB 0.8404 vs bronze 0.87372 (gap ~0.033).\n- OOF is misleadingly low; LB is the better guide on this setup.\n\nCritical blockers\n- Core bug: per-fold station priors OOF 0.304 (worse than random) while global (leaky) priors hit 0.8649 → feature/label/group misalignment in CV.\n- Noisy 239 base engineered features drown signal.\n- OOF/LB mismatch due to small dataset and GroupKFold-by-station; don’t rely on OOF for optimization when using global priors.\n\nFix-now checklist (fast, targeted)\n- Validate alignment end-to-end:\n  - Assert lengths and keys: len(groups) == n_rows; all rec_ids align across labels, histograms, priors.\n  - Verify station extraction regex; minimize ‘UNK’; print station counts and overlap train↔test.\n  - Ensure GroupKFold groups truly match station IDs; prefer StratifiedGroupKFold if available.\n- Debug per-fold priors:\n  - Print per-fold station counts and prior values; compare to global prior.\n  - Try smoothing alpha in {1, 2, 5, 10}; confirm global mean fallback is correct.\n  - Run minimal model “priors-only”; if OOF <0.5, alignment is still broken.\n- Sanity checks: shuffle-control ≈0.5 AUC; histogram row mapping after dedup preserves correct rec_id order.\n\nModel/feature plan (fastest path)\n- Drop base engineered features everywhere.\n- Use features: raw_histogram + SVD-on-hist + global (leaky) station prior.\n  - Tune SVD components {8, 12, 16, 24, 32}; scale features for LR.\n  - Optional: add a few robust meta features (e.g., segment_count_total, coverage_ratio).\n- Models:\n  - LR: [global prior + raw_hist] (±SVD); tune C ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1.0}.\n  - XGBoost: [global prior + raw_hist + SVD]; shallow trees; tune eta 0.01–0.05, max_depth 3–6, n_estimators 1000–5000; scale_pos_weight capped ~10–20.\n  - Optional LightGBM (if needed): min_data_in_leaf=1, min_child_weight=0.001; drop extra_trees if “no splits”.\n- Seed averaging: 3–5 seeds per model.\n\nEnsemble/blending (adds ~+0.01–0.03 AUC)\n- Average test probabilities from: XGB, LR, and optional LR hist-only stabilizer.\n- Start equal weights; try rank-averaging for stability.\n\nSubmission plan\n1) Submit XGB + global prior. If LB <0.87, also:\n2) Submit LR [global prior + hist] (with and without SVD).\n3) Blend submissions (mean/rank-mean) and resubmit.\n4) Add seed averaging and re-blend.\n- Smooth priors: try alpha {2, 5, 10}; pick best LB.\n- Target LB ≥0.88 to clear bronze safely. Submit iteratively.\n\nNotes\n- After fixing priors/alignment, expect OOF ≥0.75 with simple models; ensembles can reach ≥0.85 and cross bronze on LB.\n- If progress stalls, re-parse data from scratch to eliminate hidden alignment issues."

Use a smoothing factor `alpha` of 3-10.\n\n**Modeling & Blending**\n\n1.  **Model Configuration:**\n    - **XGBoost:** Tune parameters: `max_depth=4-5`, `eta=0.015-0.03`, `colsample_bytree=0.7-0.8`, `subsample=0.8-0.9`. Experiment with `scale_pos_weight` set to `sqrt(neg/pos)`.\n    - **LightGBM:** Add an LGBM model. Key parameters: `extra_trees=True`, `num_leaves=31`, `min_data_in_leaf=5`.\n    - **Linear Models:** For Ridge/Logistic Regression, use SVD on Hellinger-transformed histograms with 32-48 components.\n\n2.  **Blending Strategy:**\n    - Use a weighted average of model predictions.\n    - A strong starting blend is:\n        - 0.5 * XGBoost (average of 3 seeds)\n        - 0.3 * LightGBM (average of 3 seeds)\n        - 0.2 * Ridge/LR on SVD components\n\n**Immediate 2-Hour Action Plan**\n1.  Switch CV for all models to `StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)`.\n2.  Implement histogram improvements: drop bins 0/99, add Gaussian smoothing (sigma=1.5), and add IDF weighting.\n3.

Recompute joins/indices; ensure GroupKFold indices align with stations.\n- Station priors sanity: Your station-prior OOF ≈0.304 (worse than random) vs global ≈0.865 indicates misalignment/leakage. After fixes, a non-leaky prior should be ≥0.70 OOF.\n- Label/build checks: Recreate Y_train; confirm no fold has only negatives without fallback handling.\n\n2) Use a validation/prior strategy consistent with test\n- If test shares stations with train (typical in this benchmark): switch to KFold/StratifiedKFold (n_splits=5, shuffle, fixed seed). Compute a single Bayesian-smoothed station prior per class per station from training data, attach to train/test, and keep it fixed during CV.\n- If test holds out stations: keep GroupKFold by station; do not use leaky/global priors.\n- In both cases: apply strong smoothing (e.g., alpha ≈ 5–10) with fallback to global mean.\n\n3) Train on a minimal, high-signal feature set\n- Keep: station_prior (1D), Hellinger-transformed histograms (L1-normalized then sqrt), SVD on hist (16–32 comps, fit in-fold), small curated meta (month, hour/hour_bin, coverage/log counts).\n- Drop: the 239 base engineered segment aggregates for now (they degraded OOF). Optionally reintroduce a few via selection (e.g., top k by mutual information) only if they lift OOF.\n- Optional adds (if needed): station×time interactions; simple spectral ratios; temporal stability stats within recording.\n\n4) Models and training (simple, robust, ensemble)\n- Logistic Regression: liblinear/saga, class_weight=balanced, C≈0.3–1.0 on [prior + H_hell + SVD + curated].\n- XGBoost: tree_method=hist, max_depth=3–4, eta=0.02–0.03, subsample/colsample 0.8–0.9, min_child_weight≈1e-3, max_bin≈64, scale_pos_weight per fold prevalence, 3000–5000 rounds with early stopping≈200.\n- Optional diversity: CatBoost (balanced loss) on same features; simple NN on histograms if time allows.\n- Ensemble: mean or rank-mean blend of 2–3 diverse models with OOF ≥0.65 each. Avoid training with leaky priors.\n\n5) Sanity checks and targets\n- After alignment/CV fixes: station-prior-only OOF ≥0.70; LR/XGB OOF in 0.75–0.80 range → typically LB ≥0.87.\n- Handle degenerate folds/classes: if no positives in fold/class, use global mean predictions for that class/fold.\n- Monitor per-class AUCs; add class-specific tweaks for underperformers if needed.\n\n6) Short actionable plan\n- Today: Fix alignment; recompute priors; switch CV per test-station assumption; rerun station-prior-only baseline.\n- Next: Train LR and XGB on minimal features; 5-fold CV; 3 seeds; blend; submit.\n- If LB <0.8737: add CatBoost and selective segment features; revisit SVD dims (16–32) and smoothing; rebalance hyperparameters.\n\nGoal: Achieve stable OOF ≥0.75–0.80 with the minimal feature set and corrected CV/prior setup; this should reach bronze (and possibly silver)."

    "llm_json": "**Considering data normalization**\n\nI need to figure out how to get the square root counts effectively. It seems I should reconstruct from the original data before normalization, but I already normalized the H variable. We could have stored the raw counts before normalizing, but now I'm realizing that’s overwritten. I can recompute the raw counts only by re-reading the file. For adjustments, I might modify Cell 1 to compute both non-normalized H counts and normalized ones, including applying a Gaussian filter if I can.**Implementing data processing**\n\nI’m thinking about how to implement this with numpy using a 1D Gaussian kernel. First, I’ll drop the first and last bins after creating the arrays. For IDF weights, I must compute the document frequency per bin and calculate IDF using the formula. \n\nWhen working with trees, I should produce H_tree by normalizing the square roots of counts, apply smoothing, and perhaps drop some edges. I'll create improved arrays for training and testing. It seems I should focus on histogram transforms first by modifying Cell 1 to retain H_counts before normalization.**Rebuilding data structure**\n\nI’m planning to rebuild the process by reading the file and creating the Hc array for counts. After that, I’ll compute the L1 normalized counts, H_l1, and apply smoothing. I need to map the data to train and test orders using record IDs, but I see that I'm currently mapping with a DataFrame built from normalized counts. Instead, I'll create the hist_df_counts DataFrame for raw counts and deduplicate it by mean values. From there, I can extract arrays for both train and test using the mapping.**Computing training and test counts**\n\nI'll start by computing counts for both the training and test datasets. I need to define several variants, like a function for L1 normalization and another for creating a Gaussian kernel. For smoothing, I'll apply convolution to each row using numpy. \n\nAfter normalizing counts, I’ll drop the edge bins and calculate the IDF. Additionally, for decision trees, I want to use square root counts and normalize those as well, potentially dropping some edges too. The outputs will be the smoothed IDF arrays and the tree data. I’ll set up a try-except block without external dependencies, then plan on adding a new modeling cell later.**Switching to StratifiedKFold**\n\nI'm thinking about changing our approach from KFold to StratifiedKFold, using overall label prevalence. With multi-label data, stratifying can be tricky, but I can stratify based on the sum of labels greater than zero. I plan to make these adjustments later, but for now, I want to focus on implementing improved features first. I’ll go ahead and modify cell 1 in the notebook to reflect these changes.

    "llm_json": "**Implementing modeling plan**\n\nI’ve executed the first cell, so now it's time to implement the final modeling plan. This involves using StratifiedKFold and XGB with H_tree, curated data, and global priors. We currently have various models but need to switch to StratifiedKFold for the final push. I should add new cells to train both XGB and LGB using the necessary features. After that, we’ll need to document the plan and consult an expert at key milestones.**Requesting expert review**\n\nI’m thinking we should request an expert review before diving into the heavy training phase. The guidelines suggest checking in with an expert at major milestones, and since we've just finished data prep, it feels like a good moment. However, to save time, I could insert the modeling cell first and then request the review. But actually, it might be smarter to ask for confirmation on our approach with StratifiedKFold and feature sets right now. I'll insert the training cell and execute it, then request the expert review while it runs.**Creating new cell for modeling**\n\nI need to create a new cell at the end of the notebook that builds labels for each class and features for the models. For tree models, I’ll concatenate H_tree_train, C_train, and per-class station priors. Using StratifiedKFold with 5 splits and shuffling makes sense to ensure we account for class labels.\n\nI’ll also set up the XGBClassifier and LGBMClassifier with similar parameters. For logistic regression, I’ll use TruncatedSVD to get around 64 components and train with tuned C, ensuring I include the curated features as well.**Implementing H_idf SVD process**\n\nI’m focusing on the H_idf SVD process. I'll use multiple seeds: [42, 2025, 7] for variety in results. After running the models, I’ll save the numpy arrays and create a blended submission using weights of 0.5 for XGB, 0.3 for LGBM, and 0.2 for LR, averaging across the seeds.\n\nI need to log the out-of-fold Macro AUC for sanity checks, even if it might be leaky due to StratifiedKFold. I’ll also make sure the ST_PRIOR arrays are loaded, and then write the code in a new cell with appropriate imports, including periodic prints and timestamps.

    "llm_json": "**Exploring model blending techniques**\n\nI’m thinking about how to blend weights and consider rank averaging versus using the mean. There's also the option of stacking meta logistic regression on out-of-fold data. Plus, I wonder about per-class ensembling with the best model using geometric mean. It seems there’s a lot of potential to enhance performance through these techniques, so I’ll need to proceed carefully and thoughtfully to figure out the best approach!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"production.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint: Final push is running in Cell 17 (StratifiedKFold 5, leaky LB probe). We engineered advanced hist variants (H_tree, H_idf) and curated features in Cell 1, and built GLOBAL station priors in Cell 9. Cell 17 trains across 3 seeds: (1) XGBoost on [H_tree + curated + per-class GLOBAL prior], (2) LightGBM on same, (3) Logistic Regression on SVD(H_idf). Then we blend 0.5*XGB + 0.3*LGB + 0.2*LR and write submission.csv. Earlier LB probes: XGB-G (GroupKFold + GLOBAL prior) got LB 0.728; Path-B KFold with Hellinger+Curated+GLOBAL prior got LB 0.8265; previous blend 0.8289. Targets: \\u22650.8737 (bronze). Ask for guidance to medal: 1) Blend: Are 0.5/0.3/0.2 weights sensible, or should we rank-average per class? Any recommended per-class weights or temperature scaling for small-N classes? 2) Features: For tree models, should we add raw L1 hist (or H_idf) alongside H_tree, or is that redundant/harmful? Any tip to include a few SVD components of H_idf in trees? 3) XGB/LGB params: With N=258, C=19, severe imbalance, do you recommend shallower depth (max_depth=3-4), higher reg (lambda, min_child_weight), or smaller n_estimators with 0.05 eta? Current XGB: depth=5, eta=0.03, hist, spw, early_stop=200; LGB: num_leaves=31, depth=6, lr=0.03, early_stop=200, extra_trees. 4) CV: We switched to StratifiedKFold for LB; any better split (MultilabelStratifiedKFold) to stabilize? 5) Additional quick models worth including in blend: Ridge on SVD(H_idf + curated), Linear SVM (Platt), or CatBoost on tabular [H_tree + curated + prior]? 6) Post-processing: Clip to [1e-6, 1-1e-6] already; should we apply per-class power calibration (p^gamma) to match LB? 7) Time: Cell 17 logs show many tiny folds with degeneracies; should we reduce to 2 seeds to speed and try an alternative blend (rank-avg of per-model seed-avg) for a likely LB gain? 8) Any known winning trick for MLSP 2013 hist features (e.g., Hellinger smoothing + IDF + SVD dim like 24/48, or dropping curated features for LR)? Please advise which concrete adjustments are most likely to push from ~0.83 to \\u22650.873 on LB. We'll incorporate immediately while current training finishes.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Overall Assessment & Action Plan**\n\nYour current approach is strong but has critical flaws preventing a medal score. The consensus is to focus on stabilizing the CV, improving the blend, and making models more robust for the small, imbalanced dataset. The following prioritized changes are expected to push your score from ~0.83 to >0.874.\n\n**1. Cross-Validation (Highest Priority)**\n*   **Problem:** `StratifiedKFold` is failing on rare classes, causing unstable training and unreliable OOF scores.\n*   **Action:** Immediately replace `StratifiedKFold` with `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` from the `iterative-stratification` library. This is the single most critical fix. Use `n_splits=5`.\n\n**2. Blending Strategy**\n*   **Problem:** The fixed-weight average (0.5/0.3/0.2) is fragile and suboptimal.\n*   **Action:** Switch to **per-class rank averaging** across your seed-averaged models. This is more robust to calibration issues and class imbalance.\n*   **Optional Enhancement:** Consider applying per-class weights based on training prevalence after rank averaging. For rare classes, give more weight to tree models (e.g., XGB: 0.6, LGB: 0.3, LR: 0.1).\n\n**3. Hyperparameters (for N=258)**\n*   **Problem:** Current tree models are too deep and under-regularized, causing overfitting.\n*   **Action:** Make models shallower and more robust.\n    *   **XGBoost:** `max_depth=3-4`, `min_child_weight=5`, `lambda=1.0-2.0`, `eta=0.03-0.05`, `subsample=0.7-0.8`.\n    *   **LightGBM:** `max_depth=4-5` (or `num_leaves=16-23`), `min_data_in_leaf=10-15`, `lambda_l2=1.0-2.0`, `bagging_fraction=0.7-0.8`.\n    *   Increase `early_stopping_rounds` to 200-300 to ensure convergence with a lower learning rate.\n\n**4. Feature Engineering (Per-Model Optimization)**\n*   **Problem:** Using the same features for all models is suboptimal.\n*   **Action:**\n    *   **Tree Models (XGB/LGB):** Add SVD components to capture complementary signal. New feature set: `[H_tree, Curated_Features, GLOBAL_Prior, SVD(H_idf, n_components=16)]`.\n    *   **Linear Model (LR):** Simplify to increase model diversity. New feature set: `[SVD(H_idf, n_components=48-64)]` **only**. Remove curated features.\n\n**5. Model Diversity & Time Management**\n*   **Action (Time):** Reduce from 3 seeds to **2 seeds** (e.g., 42, 7) to free up time for the more impactful changes above.\n*   **Action (Diversity):** If time permits after implementing the above, add a fast, diverse model to the blend.\n    *   **Recommended:** `Ridge(alpha=1.0-10.0)` trained on `SVD(H_idf, k=48)`.\n    *   **Alternative:** A single-seed `CatBoost` with `depth=4`.\n\n**6. Post-Processing (Lower Priority)**\n*   **Problem:** Calibration can be risky and time-consuming.\n*   **Action:** Defer complex calibration like isotonic regression or power transforms. The switch to rank averaging mitigates most calibration issues. Keep your simple probability clipping. If you experiment, apply per-class temperature scaling (`p^(1/T)`) *before* blending, but this is a lower-priority tweak.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: raise LB from 0.82892 to ≥0.87372 by completing and optimizing the leaky ensemble in Cell 17, then submit.\n\nDo now (non‑negotiable):\n- Run Cell 17 end‑to‑end (StratifiedKFold=5, multi‑seed [42, 7, 2025]) and generate a fresh submission from:\n  - XGBoost on H_tree + curated + GLOBAL station priors\n  - LightGBM on same features\n  - Logistic/Ridge on H_idf SVD; extend LR inputs to [H_idf SVD + curated + per‑class GLOBAL prior]\n- Ensure the new blend overwrites submission.csv (Cell 13 currently copies an older file). Submit immediately.\n\nOptimize the blend before/after first submit:\n- Tune weights using leaky OOF from Cell 17. Quick grid: w_xgb∈[0.5–0.7], w_lgb∈[0.2–0.4], w_lr=1−(w_xgb+w_lgb); pick best OOF.\n- Also produce a rank‑average blend of the three models; submit both mean‑ and rank‑blends and keep the better LB.\n- Include your best Path‑B XGB (Cell 15) predictions in both mean and rank blends; often adds +0.01–0.03 AUC.\n\nIf still <0.87372, apply these targeted boosts:\n- Stability: add seeds ([123, 456]); increase folds to StratifiedKFold 7–10.\n- Features:\n  - Add H_idf SVD (24–64 comps) to tree model inputs: [H_tree + H_idf SVD + curated + GLOBAL prior].\n  - Create station×feature interaction terms; consider simple station‑specific offsets.\n  - Optional per‑class feature selection for LR.\n- Models:\n  - Add CatBoost with same features and blend.\n  - Try stacking (meta‑LR on OOF) if time allows.\n- Hyperparams:\n  - XGB/LGBM: try lower lr (0.02), depth up to 6, adjust reg if OOF plateaus.\n  - LR: try C=1.0 (less regularization).\n\nOperational checks:\n- Use StratifiedKFold for all leaky LB models (not GroupKFold).\n- Handle degenerate classes; clip probs to [1e‑6, 1−1e‑6].\n- Validate submission schema matches sample (IDs, column order).\n- Monitor Cell 17 to completion (no interruptions/warnings).\n\nBottom line:\n- Execute Cell 17 fully, blend with OOF‑tuned weights, submit both mean and rank blends (including Path‑B). Iterate weights/seeds/folds and add SVD to trees if needed to push past 0.87372."
