        "# Plan: Google Brain - Ventilator Pressure Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "Objectives:\n",
        "- Establish reliable CV mirroring test conditions; build strong baseline fast; iterate to medal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Validation:\n",
        "- GroupKFold by breath_id to prevent leakage (train/test split is by breath).\n",
        "- 5 folds, deterministic seed; log per-fold times and scores; save OOF for ensembling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Baseline v0:\n",
        "- Simple feature-engineered tabular model (XGBoost/CB on GPU) per time-step rows.\n",
        "- Features: u_in lag/lead (1..3), rolling stats (mean/std/max/min over small windows), cumulative sums, time_diff, area under u_in curve, R/C one-hot, interaction terms (u_in * R/C), u_in changes, step index (normalized), breathwise stats.\n",
        "- Train target: pressure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Seq NN v1:\n",
        "- GRU/LSTM 1D with per-breath sequences length=80; inputs: u_in, u_out, R, C plus engineered per-step features; regression head.\n",
        "- Loss: SmoothL1; early stopping on CV; AMP + GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advanced FE v2:\n",
        "- Physical-inspired: compute RC dynamics proxy: dp_est = (u_in - leak)*k - integrate(u_out), cumulative RC charge, expiratory markers, plateaus.\n",
        "- Breath-level globals appended to each step: R, C, sums, areas, peaks, counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensembling:\n",
        "- Blend tabular (XGB/CB) and GRU predictions; weight by OOF performance.\n",
        "- Calibrate blending weights via OOF minimization of metric surrogate (MAE if needed; use provided dice-hausdorff-combo if function available).\n",
        "\n",
        "Metric handling:\n",
        "- Primary dev metric: MAE on pressure (classic for this comp) as proxy if dice-hausdorff-combo impl not available locally.\n",
        "- After obtaining strong MAE CV, validate with provided metric function if supplied in environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pipeline steps:\n",
        "1) Env check (GPU) and package setup (torch cu121; xgboost/catboost).\n",
        "2) EDA: shapes, nulls, unique R/C, breath length consistency, target distribution.\n",
        "3) FE v0 and cache features to feather/parquet; strict fold-fit of scalers within CV.\n",
        "4) Baseline XGB/CB OOF + test preds; save artifacts.\n",
        "5) Seq GRU v1 with small model; OOF + test; sanity plots.\n",
        "6) Blend and generate submission.csv; iterate weights.\n",
        "7) Error analysis by breath segments (high residuals buckets) \u2192 FE v2.\n",
        "\n",
        "Runtime discipline:\n",
        "- Subsample smoke runs first (10k breaths, 2 folds) before full training.\n",
        "- Print fold/time logs; save OOF/test npy for reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next actions:\n",
        "A) Run GPU sanity check (nvidia-smi).\n",
        "B) Quick data load + EDA.\n",
        "C) Implement FE v0 and XGB baseline with 5-fold GroupKFold.\n",
        "D) Request expert review after baseline CV results; then proceed to GRU and blend."
