Preparing artifacts might involve pretrained logits or a baseline. Since we lack training mapping, it’s tough to determine product categories. I’m thinking we might predict a default category from sample_submission, but accuracy won't be great. Let’s conduct exploratory data analysis and request expert guidance. I'll document this in the notebook and seek expert review at crucial points.**Creating a project plan**\n\nI need to add a planning cell in the notebook before requesting any expert advice. First, I’ll create a plan markdown that emphasizes understanding the dataset, which only contains test data in BSON format. I should verify if there are labels embedded, but since we don’t have training data, I’m suspicious a pretrained model file might be missing. I'll inspect the directory for hidden files. Next, I’ll load the test data to examine its structure and consider using a pretrained image classifier for baseline predictions. Also, category_names.csv might help with mappings, though it lacks text descriptions.**Requesting expert insights**\n\nI need to ask experts about potential strategies and check if any artifacts are missing. After establishing a plan, I'll request an expert review. For now, I’ll insert a markdown cell outlining the plan to build a simple CNN if we can obtain training data. Since we might not have that, I’m considering using zero-shot CLIP with category names for image classification by employing text prompts. With over 5,000 categories, category_names.csv should provide needed labels. This could lead to decent accuracy, though I’m unsure if we can achieve a top performance.**Outlining steps for strategy**\n\nThe target for bronze is around 0.709, which feels high, and I suspect zero-shot might underperform, but given that the benchmark might use a small, curated test, there's a chance it could achieve a medal. So, I need to proceed with the following steps: first, verify the GPU, then parse the BSON data, and build the zero-shot CLIP pipeline. After that, I’ll set up batch inference and write the submission.csv. I should add logging and subsample initially before seeking expert advice in the next turn.

It seems like having text embeddings with 5k classes at 512 dimensions could work just fine. I'll set the image resolution to 180x180 and explore the option of upscaling.

If yes, which open_clip model(s) do you recommend balancing accuracy vs speed on a single A10-24GB (e.g., ViT-B/16, ViT-L/14, ViT-H/14, SigLIP)? Any multilingual model better if category names are French? 2) Prompt engineering: best-performing templates for product categories (e.g., \\\"a photo of a {label}\\\", French prompts, multiple templates averaged, class-normalization)? 3) Aggregation per product with multiple images: majority vote on argmax, average logits across images, or max-pool per class? Any known best practice for this dataset? 4) Efficiency: best batch sizes and dtype (fp16/bf16), precompute and cache text embeddings for ~5k labels, normalize embeddings, and use cosine similarity? Any pitfalls with CLIP preprocessing for low-res images? 5) BSON reading: recommended fast, memory-safe streaming approach and decoding to PIL; any gotchas on color mode or corrupt frames? 6) Submission mapping: We have category_names.csv and sample_submission.csv; confirm that directly mapping predicted label index to category_id is correct (i.e., ensure exact ordering). 7) If zero-shot is too weak: alternative medal-capable approaches without training data? e.g., use image clustering + label matching, or weakly-supervised retrieval with public pretrained product catalogs? 8) Any leaderboard-proven tricks specific to Cdiscount (resize strategy, TTA, mix of templates, per-superclass narrowing) that are worth implementing under 24h? I will implement with logging, subsampling smoke test, and GPU checks next.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a focused, medal-oriented game plan that merges the best advice from all four audits. Follow the priority order, ship a strong baseline fast, then add the high-ROI boosts.\n\n0) Quick sanity check (do this first)\n- Search for train data just in case: find / -name \"*train.bson*\" 2>/dev/null\n- If found, pivot to supervised training (EfficientNet/ResNet via timm, standard aug, AMP, average probs per product). If not, proceed with zero-shot below.\n\n1) Viability and model choice\n- Zero-shot can be competitive on this benchmark variant; target bronze requires strong execution.\n- Start with open_clip ViT-L/14 (laion2b_s32b_b82k). If throughput is fine, ViT-L/14-336 or SigLIP so400m patch14-384 can add a few points.\n- If labels are French: prefer multilingual SigLIP (if available) or keep ViT-L and use both FR and EN prompts.\n- If memory/throughput is tight: ViT-B/16 as fallback.\n\n2) Text prompts (make-or-break)\n- Build multiple short, product-style templates; use both FR and EN. Encode all, L2-normalize each, average per class, L2-normalize again. Cache to disk.\n- French templates:\n  - \"une photo de {}\"\n  - \"une photo produit de {}\"\n  - \"une image de {}\"\n  - \"photo d’un {}\"\n  - \"{} (produit)\"\n- English templates:\n  - \"a product photo of a {}\"\n  - \"a catalog photo of a {}\"\n  - \"an image of a {}\"\n  - \"a studio photo of a {}\"\n  - \"a {}\"\n- If category names are long with slashes/commas, keep the most specific term.\n- If hierarchy columns exist (level1/2/3), also prep “a photo of a {level3} in {level1}”.\n\n3) Aggregation across multiple images per product\n- Default: encode each image → L2-normalize → average the image embeddings across the product → score once vs text embeddings.\n- Alternative: compute similarities per image and average logits; both are solid, but averaging embeddings is faster and robust. Avoid majority vote.\n\n4) Two-stage hierarchical narrowing (big win if hierarchy exists)\n- Stage 1: zero-shot only level1 (or level2) classes; predict top superclass.\n- Stage 2: restrict to that superclass’s children (level3) and rescore for the final pick.\n- Implement after baseline; often +5–10% over flat 5k-class scoring.\n\n5) Efficiency defaults (A10-24GB)\n- Precompute text embeddings once; keep in fp32 (or fp16 after L2-norm). 5k classes is tiny.\n- Image encoding: torch.no_grad + autocast(fp16). Use model’s official preprocess (Resize/CentreCrop, mean/std). Convert all images to RGB.\n- Batch sizes (fp16, guide):\n  - ViT-B/16-224: 512–1024\n  - ViT-L/14-224: 256–512\n  - ViT-L/14-336 or SigLIP-384: 128–256\n- Similarity: cosine = matmul of normalized image and text embeddings. Temperature scaling won’t change argmax; skip unless you calibrate.\n\n6) BSON streaming and decoding (robust I/O)\n- Iterate with bson.decode_file_iter(open('test.bson','rb')).\n- For each picture: Image.open(BytesIO(pic)).convert(\"RGB\"); handle PIL.UnidentifiedImageError in try/except; skip bad frames.\n- Stream product-by-product; do not load full file. If a product loses all images (rare), assign a safe fallback (e.g., most frequent category) to keep submission complete.\n\n7) Submission mapping (avoid the #1 leaderboard bug)\n- Do NOT assume index == category_id.\n- Build your class list from category_names.csv once:\n  - class_ids = ordered list of category_id you will use consistently.\n  - class_names = parallel list used to build prompts in the same order.\n- Predicted index i maps to class_ids[i].\n- Write submission in the exact product_id order from sample_submission.csv.\n\n8) Quick, high-ROI boosts (add after baseline works)\n- TTA: also encode horizontally flipped images; average embeddings with the original.\n- Template mix: use both FR and EN templates; average per class.\n- Multiscale (optional if time): encode at 224 and 336/384; average image embeddings.\n- Tiny ensemble (optional if time): ViT-L/14 + SigLIP; weighted average of image embeddings or of similarities.\n\n9) What to monitor (smoke test on ~200–1000 products)\n- Throughput (imgs/sec), GPU mem, and a quick sanity check: nearest few classes for random samples look semantically plausible.\n- Verify submission shape and mapping on a tiny dry run.\n\nMinimal implementation outline\n- Load category_names.csv → build class_ids, class_names (and hierarchy maps if available).\n- Build FR+EN templates → tokenize/encode all texts → L2-normalize → average per class → L2-normalize → cache.\n- Stream test.bson:\n  - Collect product images → preprocess → batch encode to embeddings → L2-normalize → average (+flip TTA if used).\n  - If using two-stage: score level1, choose branch, then score level3 within branch; else score flat.\n  - Argmax → map to category_id.\n- Emit submission matching sample_submission order.\n\nSafe defaults to start\n- Model: open_clip ViT-L/14 (laion2b_s32b_b82k).\n- Batch size: 256 (adjust up/down once confirmed).\n- Dtype: fp16 for images; fp32 cached text embeddings.\n- Aggregation: average image embeddings; cosine similarity.\n- Templates: 5 FR + 5 EN as above.\n- TTA: original + horizontal flip.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Misaligned index ↔ category_id mapping.\n- Not L2-normalizing both image and text embeddings.\n- Deviating from the model’s preprocess (mean/std, resize/crop).\n- Loading BSON into memory; leaking file handles; not handling corrupt images.\n- Writing submission in the wrong product_id order.\n\nIf zero-shot underperforms\n- Add hierarchical narrowing (strongest internal boost).\n- Try SigLIP-384 or ViT-L/14-336; keep FR+EN prompts.\n- As a last resort, translate labels to English (programmatically) and compare vs FR-only; keep the better.\n\nExecute: ship the flat baseline first, verify mapping and format, then add TTA + FR/EN templates, then hierarchy. This sequence maximizes your chance to hit bronze within 24h.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Pivot to supervised training on the provided train data; zero-shot CLIP cannot reach 0.70+.\n\nConcise plan\n- Verify data and build label maps\n  - List files; locate train.bson (or train_* shards/derived train.csv), test.bson, category_names.csv, sample_submission.csv.\n  - Build cat2idx (category_id → 0..N-1) and idx2cat for submission.\n  - Parse BSON by streaming; group images by product_id. Labels are at product level.\n\n- Data pipeline (efficient and correct)\n  - Train split: stratified by category_id at product level; 5–10% held-out val. No product leakage.\n  - Multi-image handling: during training sample 1–3 images per product and average logits; at inference average logits across all images per product_id.\n  - Transforms: RandomResizedCrop(180–224), HFlip, ColorJitter/AutoAugment, Normalize. Use mixed precision, DataLoader workers, caching where possible.\n  - Address imbalance: class-weighted CrossEntropy or weighted sampler; focal loss optional.\n\n- Strong baseline model (fast to bronze)\n  - ImageNet-pretrained backbone: ResNet-50/EfficientNet-B3/ConvNeXt-T; adjust final layer to N classes (~5k).\n  - Loss/opt: CrossEntropy + label smoothing (0.05–0.1); AdamW or SGD+momentum; weight decay 1e-4–1e-5.\n  - LR schedule: warmup + cosine (or ReduceLROnPlateau). Batch size as large as fits. Train 5–10 epochs, monitor product-level val accuracy.\n  - Optional easy gains: mixup/cutmix (light), hierarchical auxiliary heads (level1/2) for +2–5%.\n\n- Inference and submission\n  - For each test product: run all images (+ simple TTA: hflip, a couple crops), average logits, argmax.\n  - Map idx → original category_id; follow sample_submission order and types.\n\n- Common pitfalls to avoid\n  - Treating images as independently labeled (labels are per product).\n  - Not aggregating multiple images at train/inference.\n  - Forgetting non-contiguous category_id mapping.\n  - Loading BSON fully into memory; not using workers/AMP.\n  - Data leakage between train/val.\n\nIteration roadmap\n- Baseline (single backbone, proper aggregation, aug, AMP) should surpass median; with solid training it can reach bronze.\n- To push higher: stronger backbones (EfficientNet-B4/ViT), more aug/TTA, hierarchical multi-task, and 2–3 model ensembles (average product-level logits) for +3–5%.\n\nActionable next steps (do now)\n1) Inventory files; confirm/train data presence; build cat2idx/idx2cat.\n2) Implement streaming BSON Dataset at product level; create stratified product-level val split.\n3) Fine-tune ResNet-50/EfficientNet-B3 @224 with the above settings; track product-level metrics.\n4) Generate predictions with image-logit averaging (+hflip TTA); create submission.csv.\n5) Iterate: tune LR/aug, add label smoothing/imbalance handling; consider hierarchical heads; then ensemble if time remains."

    "llm_json": "**Troubleshooting GPU issues**\n\nI need to address several points here. First off, the GPU is unavailable, which is problematic since I need it. It seems like there's a mismatch between the installed torch and the driver, as torch installed is 2.8 with CUDA 12.8 wheels, but cuda is not available. Though the hardware specs suggest a GPU is present, I should run diagnostics to check the situation. Also, I need to adjust the code for the sample submission columns, which are _id and category_id, not product_id.**Setting up environment for GPU**\n\nI’m considering whether I need to set environment variables. In the Kaggle container, the GPU works well, so I should run a diagnostic cell separately here. I also need to update cell 1 to avoid crashing on product_id, although it has already been executed—not critical though. Before computing text embeddings, I definitely need the GPU, as encoding 52,000 texts on the CPU would be too slow. I plan to run a small subset first to validate my pipeline, perhaps by using a subsample flag to limit the classes to 200.**Modifying code cells**\n\nI’m planning to edit cell 2 to implement some necessary changes before executing it. I’ll also update cell 1 to fix the sample_submission product_id reference, changing it to _id, even though cell 1 has already been run, making it less critical. For cell 2, I need to add a parameter for SUBSAMPLE_CLASSES, allowing selection of the first N classes if it’s set. Additionally, I’ll ensure there’s a printout to warn when CUDA is unavailable and confirm that loading the open_clip model on the CPU is fine.

    "llm_json": "**Troubleshooting GPU issues**\n\nI need to figure out why the GPU is showing as unavailable. It seems the CUDA toolkit is present, but PyTorch isn't detecting the GPU, even though the hardware indicates it's there. Maybe the nvidia-container runtime is missing? Torch indicates it's not recognizing it, which is puzzling. Permissions could be at play, but I’ve imported torch and checked. While we can proceed with CPU encoding for now, it will be slower. I’ll implement inference streaming with specific subsampling to test efficiently.**Implementing BSON streaming**\n\nI need to implement BSON streaming by using `bson.decode_file_iter`. For each product, I’ll access fields like `_id` (product_id as an int) and `imgs`, which is a list of dictionaries containing 'picture'. I’ll decompress to PIL and preprocess images through the model to obtain tensors. While processing multiple images per product, I'll batch them into the model, normalize embeddings, and possibly use test time augmentation (TTA). \n\nI'll also use cosine similarity for scoring and set up subsampling for smoke testing, keeping an eye on GPU usage with `torch.autocast`. It’s important to organize this correctly!**Enhancing prediction process**\n\nI need to establish progress prints and speed for the implementation. It’s crucial to write predictions to a dictionary that maps product_id to cat_id. For submission, I’ll merge this with the ordered structure from `ss`, creating a DataFrame with `_id` and mapped categories. If there are missing predictions, I could fill those with the most frequent category_id or fallback to the first class id. I’ll implement a cell for smoke tests with the subsample and avoid writing submissions unless the FULL_RUN flag is true. \n\nAfter coding cell 3, I plan to execute cell 2 for text embeddings on CPU before running cell 3 with SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS set to 200. I’ll just need to do one execution at a time! Plus, I need to fix a bug in cell 1 related to product_id printing, even if it’s not crucial.**Inserting new code cell**\n\nI realize that I can only edit one cell per turn, but I can still insert a new cell. So, I'll go ahead and insert a new code cell at index 3 to implement the inference process. This will help keep things organized and clear as I move forward with the updates. It's important to structure my work efficiently, ensuring everything flows smoothly in the implementation!

I think I should wait for cell 2 to finish and then run cell 3 with a small sample for submission.**Considering GPU alternatives**\n\nI’m thinking about requesting an expert review regarding the GPU issue and potential alternative CPU-friendly approaches. One idea is to switch to CLIP ViT-B/16 to speed things up since text embeddings are independent of image inference. If GPU isn’t available, I could modify the model in cell 2 to ViT-B/16.

    "llm_json": "**Planning inference strategy**\n\nI need to take the next step now that the pipeline works on CPU for 300 products and I've created submission.csv. However, accuracy might be low due to the subsampled classes and early stopping. Winning a medal is the goal, but if we can’t access a GPU, we might have to run full inference on CPU using a smaller model like ViT-B/16. Still, running 706,990 products could take too long—around 17 days based on our earlier processing times. I need an alternative approach!**Exploring new prediction strategies**\n\nI need a different approach since this MLE-benchmark likely wants us to use the provided artifacts for quick predictions. I wonder if there's a pretrained index mapping images to categories using hashing, but the only available files are category_names.csv, test.bson, and sample_submission.csv. Without a GPU, options are limited. I could consider a trivial baseline that assigns each product the most common category, though accuracy would likely be near zero. The medal threshold is high, so it might be worth consulting experts again for more guidance.**Modifying prediction approach**\n\nI need to adjust the method to use flat predictions only for the sample IDs in the first N processed, as falling back for others isn't ideal. I suspect that test.bson might only contain those first N product IDs. There’s a submission ready, but the score might be low. To earn a medal, I have to consider a smaller model and hierarchical narrowing to limit the class count while still processing 700k products. However, since GPU availability is an issue, options might be limited.**Investigating hardware options**\n\nI see the hardware is described as available, but my previous check shows it as not accessible. Maybe I can install nvidia-ml-py3 and check with nvidia-smi, but if it’s not exposed, there's no way around it. The competition guidelines suggest checking GPU after installing torch, but it still isn’t available. I could try using OpenCLIP with ONNXRuntime for CPU acceleration and multithreading. Additionally, I could use a smaller model like ViT-B/32 and implement hierarchical narrowing to speed things up. It seems like we might need to compute image embeddings first to keep scoring efficient!**Optimizing image processing**\n\nThe expensive part is the forward pass for encode_image, which doesn’t depend on the number of classes. To speed up processing, I need a smaller model and to reduce the image preprocessing size—maybe resize to 180 or 128. Switching to ViT-B-32 or RN50 and using batched processing across multiple images could help. I should leverage the CPU's 36 vCPUs by setting `torch.set_num_threads(36)`. Implementing batch inference with ViT-B/32 could significantly speed things up, and I’ll also need to adjust the text embeddings dimensions to match up.

Running full inference on CPU only, I'll utilize the ViT-B/32 model, but I must compute the text embeddings for that. I need to modify cell 3 to disable TTA and use batching for efficiency. It's crucial to include all 5270 class text embeddings for better labeling accuracy. I'll set SUBSAMPLE_CLASSES=None for computation.**Analyzing inference challenges**\n\nRunning inference over 706,990 products on the CPU will be quite slow if I process images one by one. The test.bson file is small, but the sample submission has 706,990 product IDs, compared to the original 176k. The time it will take seems daunting. I noticed all category IDs are the same for the first few rows. Without a GPU, I could explore processing smaller images with the ViT-B/32 model, but it may still not be feasible. A simpler CNN could be a solution, but there are no train labels, making zero-shot the only option.**Evaluating CPU strategy**\n\nI think we should reach out to the expert again about using a CPU-only strategy. There's a chance the benchmark only expects a subset of the data present in test.bson, but I'm seeing that sample IDs are 706k. I need to quickly count the products in test.bson. Writing a fast pass to count documents makes sense, but decoding BSON means I still have to read the file. It’s okay to read it to count, so I’ll print the file size using os.path.getsize, and checking the first 5000 entries might help estimate the total count.**Updating batching strategy**\n\nI need to update cell 3 to disable TTA and implement batching for product processing. The current approach averages image embeddings per product, which is okay but involves serial encoding. Instead, I can collect images of multiple products into a batch and then split the embeddings afterward. I should also set SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS=None for a full run. First, I'll run a quick profile with 1000 products using ViT-B/32 and no TTA to measure images per second. \n\nMy plan includes modifying cell 2 for all 5270 classes, keeping the model as ViT-B/32, then modifying cell 3 for batching and profiling.**Editing cell sequentially**\n\nSince I'm limited to using a single tool per turn, I'll proceed sequentially.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating processing options**\n\nI'm facing a challenge because the GPU is unavailable and the CPU is too slow for my tasks. While we've created a submission file from our tests, scoring will not be great. I think about using hierarchical narrowing with category names to boost accuracy, but the bottleneck is encoding images. If we encode all images at once, that might help, but it would take a long time to process all products. I need to check the test data to see if it might be smaller than expected.**Exploring category mapping**\n\nI'm considering only using ID mapping for categories based on sample submissions, which shows some IDs mapping to the same category. But our inference gives different results, and without labels, I can't really optimize our approach. Another thought is to analyze the category hierarchy based on ID patterns, but that seems unlikely to help. It might be useful to count the documents in the test data quickly. Plus, we could fix a KeyError issue. Given hardware limits, maybe an expert will suggest a smaller model or methods like multiprocessing to boost performance.**Counting products for processing**\n\nI think the benchmark test data might be small enough, so I need to count the products to see if processing them on the CPU is feasible. I’ll add a new code cell to quickly count the documents and average the images. This way, I can get a clearer idea of what I'm dealing with.

However, we already have one, and for an accurate final score, we need to include all products. But the CPU won't finish processing the entire 706k. Since embeddings are running, I should request an expert review on the CPU strategy now.**Exploring CPU optimization**\n\nI need to think through our CPU optimization options. I can only use one tool per turn, so I should provide the notebook path along with questions. I’m considering OpenCLIP with ONNXRuntime, resizing to 128, using RN50, or employing multiprocessing. For text embeddings, we might memmap them and use the torchvision ResNet50 feature extractor for nearest neighbor searches. However, image encoding may dominate. I should also think about hierarchical narrowing for class reduction at scoring time. I'll request expert advice now.**Requesting expert review**\n\nI should request an expert review to explain our current situation: the GPU is unavailable, and we need to maximize CPU throughput. I’m thinking of proposing ViT-B/32 with a batch size of 1,024, using 36 threads, disabling TTA, and maybe even considering int8 quantization. Using ONNX for the quantized CLIP might be heavy, though.

Any proven settings to reach >50\\u2013100 imgs/sec?\\n2) Any lighter zero-shot models with strong performance per FLOP (e.g., OpenCLIP RN50, ConvNeXt-CLIP, SigLIP CPU) that you recommend here? Is ONNXRuntime or OpenVINO inference for CLIP a practical speedup to set up quickly?\\n3) Accuracy vs speed trade: With ViT-B/32 and trimmed prompts (FR+EN), can we hit above-median or bronze on this benchmark variant? If not, what minimal enhancements (e.g., add back 10 prompts, hierarchy narrowing) are most impactful given CPU constraints (remember image encode dominates)?\\n4) Hierarchical narrowing: Worth implementing now? Plan would be to encode all images once, then score Level1 prompts first, then only children Level3 per predicted Level1. It barely changes compute (scoring is cheap) but may help accuracy. Confirm if typical +5\\u201310% holds in zero-shot here.\\n5) Product-level aggregation: I average image embeddings; any better CPU-friendly aggregation (e.g., average logits vs embeddings) under zero-shot?\\n6) Submission completeness: Is it acceptable to produce a submission by predicting a subset (e.g., 100\\u2013200k products) and filling the rest with fallback category? Or will that doom the score? If unacceptable, suggest a way to cover all 706k on CPU in ~6\\u201310 hours.\\n7) If zero-shot CPU is a dead end, any alternative strategy with provided artifacts (category_names.csv + test.bson only) that could medal without supervised training (e.g., retrieval via generic product image datasets, or simple visual clustering + prompt matching)?\\n\\nWe plan: finalize text embeds (running now), profile CPU inference throughput on 2k products, then decide to (a) switch to RN50/ViT-B/16, (b) reduce resolution, (c) attempt ONNXRuntime, and/or (d) implement hierarchy. Please advise the fastest path to a medal under CPU-only constraints.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the most direct, medal-oriented path synthesized from all reviews.\n\nCritical fixes first\n- Fix sample_submission key: use ss['_id'] everywhere (you hit a KeyError).\n- Use the same model for text and image encoders. If you switch models (e.g., to RN50), rebuild text embeddings with that exact model+pretrained+prompts.\n- Remove SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS for the full run only after profiling.\n\nAnswers to your questions\n\n1) Fastest CPU-only config (target ≥35–60 imgs/s; 6–10h full run)\n- Model: open_clip RN50 or RN50-quickgelu (laion400m_e32 or laion2b_s34b_b88k). Faster than ViTs on CPU with similar zero-shot accuracy on products.\n- Resolution: 224 native. If throughput <35 imgs/s after all optimizations, try 180–160 (expect small accuracy hit).\n- Threads/env (set before importing torch):\n  - OMP_NUM_THREADS=12, MKL_NUM_THREADS=12, OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=12, NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=12\n  - KMP_AFFINITY=granularity=fine,compact,1,0\n  - In code: torch.set_num_threads(12); torch.set_num_interop_threads(1); torch.backends.mkldnn.enabled = True\n- Memory format: keep default (NCHW); channels_last usually doesn’t help here.\n- Batch size: start 256, try 128–384, pick peak throughput on a 2k-product profile. Batch across images from many products (you already do).\n- Decoding: PIL convert('RGB'), bilinear resize, no TTA. Avoid per-image Python overhead in hot loops.\n\n2) Lighter models and runtimes\n- Best per-FLOP: RN50 / RN50-quickgelu. Avoid ViT-B/16 on CPU; SigLIP is strong but heavier for CPU.\n- ONNX Runtime: very practical and high ROI (often 1.5–2x vs PyTorch CPU). Export only the image encoder, keep text in PyTorch (one-time). If available, run ORT quantization (int8/avx2) for extra speed. OpenVINO is similar but more setup—use only if ORT underperforms.\n\n3) Accuracy vs speed\n- ViT-B/32 + trimmed prompts likely above median but not bronze. With RN50 + 6–10 prompts (FR+EN) + hierarchy, bronze is realistic.\n- Add 6–10 prompts; text encoding is cheap. Examples:\n  - FR: “une photo de {}”, “une photo produit de {}”, “une image de {}”, “photo d’un {}”, “{} (produit)”\n  - EN: “a product photo of a {}”, “an image of a {}”, “a {}”, “a catalog photo of a {}”\n- Do not add TTA or multi-scale on CPU.\n\n4) Hierarchical narrowing\n- Yes—implement now. Typical +5–10% absolute in zero-shot with 5k classes.\n- Encode once. Score Level1 first → restrict to children Level3 → rescore and pick final. Scoring cost is negligible.\n\n5) Product-level aggregation\n- Best: L2-normalize each image embedding → average → L2-normalize the product vector → score. Faster and as good/better than averaging logits.\n\n6) Submission completeness\n- Partial prediction + fallback will tank the score. You must cover all 706,990.\n- To fit 6–10h:\n  - RN50 or RN50-quickgelu @224\n  - Threading settings above\n  - Batch 128–384\n  - ONNX Runtime (and quantization if time)\n  - Stream BSON once; optionally pick 1–2 images per product (by largest byte size or entropy/variance) if throughput still low—this can roughly 2x speed with small accuracy loss.\n  - Parallelize I/O/decoding lightly (e.g., threads) but keep model forward single pipeline to avoid contention.\n\n7) Alternatives if zero-shot CPU fails\n- Don’t pivot to clustering/retrieval—unlikely to beat optimized CLIP here without train data. Zero-shot + hierarchy is your best shot.\n\nPriority action plan (fastest path)\n1) Fix ss['_id'] bug and ensure model consistency (text/image).\n2) Switch to open_clip RN50 or RN50-quickgelu; rebuild text embeds with 6–10 FR+EN prompts; cache.\n3) Implement Level1→Level3 hierarchical narrowing (precompute L1 and L3 text embeddings and L1→children map).\n4) Optimize CPU threading and batch size; profile on ~2k products. If <35 imgs/s, export image encoder to ONNX Runtime (then try ORT int8 quantization).\n5) If still slow, keep RN50 but downscale to 180 or 160, and/or encode only 1–2 images per product.\n6) Launch full run; write submission in sample order; fallback only for products with no valid images.\n\nNotes\n- If you regain GPU, just keep the same logic with ViT-B/32 or ViT-L/14 and larger batch; but don’t wait on that.\n- Ensemble only if time remains (averaging RN50 + ViT-B/32 image embeddings) since it doubles image-encode time for small gains.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: pivot to supervised training on labeled data, fix environment, and implement a strong CNN pipeline with per-product aggregation, hierarchy, and careful data handling.\n\nPriorities (do these now)\n- Locate labeled training artifacts:\n  - Search workspace for train data or precomputed labels/embeddings: find . -type f | grep -Ei 'train|label|fold|lmdb|tfrecord|parquet|npy|npz|pt|pkl|h5|idx|map|emb'\n  - If missing, use Kaggle API to download train.bson (accept rules), then stream with bson.decode_file_iter.\n- Enable GPU: verify torch.cuda.is_available(); if false, install correct CUDA torch wheel and confirm GPU name/memory. Without GPU, downsample for a POC only.\n- Fix submission schema: use columns [\"_id\",\"category_id\"] in sample_submission order.\n\nData pipeline\n- Stream BSON; never load all into RAM. Decode images via PIL, convert to RGB, handle corrupt images gracefully.\n- Multi-image per product:\n  - Train: treat each image as a sample with the product label.\n  - Inference: average logits/probabilities across a product’s images (not features), then argmax to category_id.\n\nModel and training recipe (baseline that can reach bronze)\n- Backbone: ResNet50 / EfficientNet-B0/B3 / ConvNeXt-T pretrained on ImageNet; input 180–224 px.\n- Head: Linear layer to 5270 classes. Save idx2id/id2idx mapping aligned to category_id.\n- Loss/opt:\n  - Cross-entropy with label smoothing 0.1.\n  - AdamW, cosine schedule with warmup; EMA optional.\n  - Mixed precision (fp16/amp), gradient accumulation if needed.\n- Augmentations: RandomResizedCrop(224), hflip, light ColorJitter; optionally RandAugment + light MixUp/CutMix.\n- Imbalance: class-balanced sampler or class weights; consider focal loss as alternative.\n- Training plan: 5–20 epochs depending on data size/time; progressive resizing optional (e.g., 160→224).\n- Validation: hold out 10–20% by product_id; track top-1 product-level accuracy.\n\nHierarchy and boosts\n- Use category_names.csv hierarchy:\n  - Option A: single model with standard loss.\n  - Option B (adds 2–5%): hierarchical heads (level1/2/3) or hierarchical loss; constrain predictions to valid paths.\n- Test-time tricks:\n  - Horizontal flip TTA (small bump).\n  - Ensemble 2–3 diverse backbones by averaging logits (budget permitting).\n\nIf you find precomputed embeddings\n- Train a linear/MLP classifier on train embeddings; infer embeddings for test; average logits per product; map indices back to category_id.\n\nImplementation milestones\n- Data discovery + mapping: build consistent class index ↔ category_id; cache mappings.\n- Datasets/Dataloaders: streaming decoder, balanced sampler.\n- Train loop: AMP, LR scheduler, checkpoints, early stopping on val accuracy.\n- Inference: stream test, per-image logits, per-product average, write submission in sample order.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Zero-shot only: won’t medal with 5k+ classes.\n- Averaging features instead of logits for multi-image aggregation.\n- Class index ↔ category_id mismatch.\n- Loading full BSON into memory.\n- Ignoring imbalance or overfitting small downsized sets.\n- Wrong submission columns/order/types.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Stop zero-shot; find/bring in labeled data; turn on GPU.\n- Train an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet/EfficientNet with CE+label smoothing, balanced sampling, and standard augmentations.\n- Validate by product; at inference, average logits across all images per product; ensure exact id mapping and submission format.\n- Add hierarchy-aware training and light TTA; ensemble if time allows. This path targets ≥0.71+ for bronze.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-20 19:18:36] Cell 2 has been executing for 159s and is still executing.

I also have to fix a KeyError in cell 1 related to 'product_id'. To proceed, I plan to modify cell 1 to use '_id' and implement a hierarchy from level1 to level3. \n\nI'll need to optimize threading environment variables, but since imports already happened, I might create a new cell to set those up. Restarting the kernel would clear cached embeddings, but we can recompute them with RN50. My plan is to make the necessary changes in cell 1 first, and then tackle RN50 after.**Setting environment variables**\n\nIn the notebook, I want to set `os.environ` before importing torch, but since torch is already imported in the session, I need to restart the kernel to run the cells in order. My plan is to first edit cell 1 to fix the print statement. After that, I could either add a new cell or modify cell 2 to use RN50 with more prompts and hierarchy.\n\nSince I can only edit one cell at a time, I'll focus on the minimal fix for now. I’ll modify cell 1 to change the print line to display the unique '_id' or remove it entirely. This should help avoid confusion moving forward.**Fixing print statement**\n\nI need to modify the print statement to make it clearer. Instead of printing 'Unique product_ids...', I'll change it to display the number of unique '_id'. This small adjustment should help avoid confusion and provide more precise information about the data. It’s a simple fix, but necessary for clarity.

Implemented RN50 (openai) with 9 FR+EN templates, per-class prompt ensembling, and 2-stage hierarchical narrowing (Level1 -> restricted Level3 children). Text embeddings for 5,270 L3 and 49 L1 are being encoded/cached in Cell 2 (currently ~3500/5270 complete). Cell 3 implements CPU-efficient streaming inference over test.bson with cross-product image batching, per-product image-embedding averaging, then hierarchical scoring. Planned next: run Cell 3 with SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS=2000 to profile throughput and decide feasibility for full run.\\n\\nRequests:\\n1) Approach sanity: With CPU-only RN50 and hierarchical narrowing, is a medal accuracy achievable? Rough expected accuracy range for this setup?\\n2) Hierarchy: Should we switch to 3-stage (L1 -> L2 -> L3) if category_level2 is available, or use beam at L1 (top-k, e.g., k=2-3) before scoring children to improve recall? What k would you recommend on CPU?\\n3) Prompts: We use 9 templates (FR+EN). Any must-have template variants or phrasing tweaks for retail product catalogs that give measurable gains? Should we add brand/category keywords like 'Cdiscount' or 'catalogue' in FR?\\n4) Text embedding aggregation: We average normalized embeddings over templates. Is mean the best on CPU, or does max/median/weighted (e.g., learned weights not possible) empirically help in zero-shot CLIP for large label sets?\\n5) Image preprocessing: Using open_clip RN50 preprocess (224). Any CPU-speed vs accuracy trade better than defaults (e.g., Resize 256 -> center-crop 224 is default). Any benefit to disabling antialiasing or switching interpolation to bilinear-only for speed?\\n6) Inference knobs: Current BATCH_IMAGES=256, torch.set_num_threads(12), interop=1, mkldnn enabled. Do you recommend different threads/interop on 36 vCPUs for best throughput? Target imgs/sec we should aim for on A10 CPU-only box?\\n7) Dtype/engines: On CPU, stay fp32? Would bfloat16/float16 with torch.cpu possibly help or hurt? Is exporting RN50 image encoder to ONNX Runtime (CPU Execution Provider) a worthwhile speedup here? If yes, estimated speedup and the minimal graph changes to export open_clip RN50 encode_image reliably?\\n8) Scoring details: We L2-normalize features and use cosine via dot product. Any benefit in temperature scaling for text embeddings (e.g., multiply similarities by a constant) or per-class norm adjustments in zero-shot?\\n9) Multi-image aggregation: We average per-product image features. Any win from max/median or robust averaging (e.g., clip outliers) for catalog products?\\n10) Safety/fallbacks: For products not encountered during streaming (due to subsample/full run timing), we currently fill with a default class. For full LB submission we will process all products; otherwise, is there a smarter lightweight heuristic fallback (e.g., nearest L1 top class) we should implement?\\n\\nIf you think throughput will be insufficient for full 706,990 products with RN50 CPU-only, please suggest a concrete plan B: ONNX Runtime setup instructions for RN50 encode_image, or switching to a smaller open_clip model that still performs competitively, and any key hyperparameters to retain medal chances. Also, please flag any obvious mistakes in our current Cell 3 pipeline or hierarchy map construction we should fix before the profiling run completes.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the distilled, medal-focused guidance, merging the best from all audits and tailored to your current notebook and logs.\n\nBottom line\n- Accuracy: With RN50 + strong FR/EN prompts + hierarchical narrowing, expect ~0.65–0.73. Bronze is realistic; silver possible if everything clicks.\n- Throughput: Your current ~2.2 products/s will not finish. You must optimize. Goal: ≥25 imgs/s (ideally 35–60+) to safely finish all products.\n\nHigh-impact changes (do these first)\n1) L1 beam search to protect recall\n- Replace L1 argmax with top-k. Use k=2 (k=3 if still fast).\n- For each product, union all L3 children from top-k L1s, score only those, pick argmax.\n- This keeps your simple 2-stage design but fixes most L1 misroutes with tiny cost.\n\n2) ONNX Runtime for image encoder if imgs/s <25\n- Export only model.visual to ONNX (opset 14–17; dynamic batch). Expect 1.3–2.5x speedup.\n- Optional dynamic quantization (INT8 weights) for another ~10–25% speedup; verify small/no accuracy drop on a 2k sample.\n\n3) Process fewer images per product\n- Use only the largest image per product by JPEG byte size (or top-2 if safe). This can 2x throughput with small accuracy loss.\n\n4) Threading and batch size\n- Before importing torch: set OMP_NUM_THREADS, MKL_NUM_THREADS, OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS = 24.\n- torch.set_num_threads(18–24), torch.set_num_interop_threads(1).\n- Tune BATCH_IMAGES in [192, 256, 320, 384, 512]; pick the best imgs/s on your 2k run.\n\nAnswers to your 10 requests\n1) Viability/accuracy: Yes. With RN50 CPU-only + hierarchy + good prompts, ~0.65–0.73 is typical; bronze plausible if you process all data.\n\n2) Hierarchy: Use L1 top-k beam (k=2; k=3 if still fast). This gives a bigger/safer gain than adding a strict L2 stage. If L2 is cleanly available, you can do L1→L2→L3 later, but prioritize L1 beam first.\n\n3) Prompts: Your 9 FR+EN are good. Add 2–4 product-context variants (e.g., EN: “a studio photo of a {}”, “packaging of a {}”; FR: “photo studio d’un {}”, “l’emballage d’un {}”). Avoid brand/site words like “Cdiscount” (can hurt); one “catalog photo” variant is okay.\n\n4) Text aggregation: Keep mean of per-template normalized embeddings, then L2-normalize. Max/median/weights don’t reliably help here.\n\n5) Preprocessing: Defaults are solid. For speed with minimal loss: switch to bilinear and disable antialias on resize. If still slow, drop to 192 (Resize 224→center-crop 192 or Resize shortest=224 then center-crop 192).\n\n6) Inference knobs: On 36 vCPUs, use 18–24 intra threads, interop=1, mkldnn=True. Target ≥25 imgs/s; 35–60 imgs/s is ideal.\n\n7) Dtype/engines: Stay fp32 on PyTorch CPU. ONNX Runtime (CPU EP) is worth it (1.3–2.5x). Minimal export is model.visual with dynamic batch; run ORT on NCHW float32 and keep your PyTorch cosine scoring. Optional: onnxruntime.quantization.quantize_dynamic to INT8 weights.\n\n8) Scoring: L2-normalize features; cosine via dot is correct. Temperature scaling won’t change argmax—skip. No per-class norm hacks needed.\n\n9) Multi-image aggregation: Mean of L2-normalized features per product, then L2-normalize, is best. If time-bound, limit to 1–2 largest images.\n\n10) Safety/fallbacks: Don’t default a fixed class. If a product truly has no valid images, predict L1 (flat over L1) then choose the most similar L3 among that L1’s children. But the real solution is to ensure you process all products.\n\nConcrete ONNX steps (minimal)\n- pip install onnxruntime\n- Export visual:\n  - model.eval(); visual = model.visual.to('cpu')\n  - dummy = torch.randn(1,3,224,224)\n  - torch.onnx.export(visual, dummy, \"rn50_visual.onnx\", opset_version=14, input_names=[\"images\"], output_names=[\"feats\"], dynamic_axes={\"images\": {0:\"batch\"}, \"feats\": {0:\"batch\"}})\n- Inference:\n  - sess = ort.InferenceSession(\"rn50_visual.onnx\", providers=[\"CPUExecutionProvider\"])\n  - Optionally set sess_options.intra_op_num_threads = 24\n  - feats = sess.run(None, {\"images\": batch.cpu().numpy()})[0]\n  - Convert to torch, L2-normalize, proceed.\n- Optional quantization:\n  - from onnxruntime.quantization import quantize_dynamic, QuantType\n  - quantize_dynamic(\"rn50_visual.onnx\",\"rn50_visual_int8.onnx\",weight_type=QuantType.QInt8)\n\nIf still slow: Plan B model/size\n- Try open_clip RN50-quickgelu (laion400m_e32) for slight speedup with comparable ZS accuracy.\n- As last resort, input 160–192 and single image/product.\n\nFixes/flags for your notebook\n- Cell 1: KeyError from ss['product_id']—use ss['_id'].\n- Ensure Cell 2 finishes and text embeddings match the image encoder you use for inference (don’t change model after encoding text).\n- In Cell 3:\n  - Add L1 top-k beam in hierarchical_score.\n  - After averaging per-product features, L2-normalize (you already do this—good).\n  - Log imgs/s based on images processed, not just products.\n  - Implement “largest image per product” selection before preprocess for speed.\n- Environment: set OMP_NUM_THREADS/MKL/OPENBLAS before importing torch.\n- Cache: keep your label order JSON to prevent mismatch (you do—good).\n\nExecution plan (time-critical)\n1) Let Cell 2 finish text embeddings (add 2–4 new templates first if you will).\n2) Implement L1 top-2 beam and “largest image only” in Cell 3.\n3) Profile with SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS=2000 while sweeping:\n   - threads {18, 24}, batch {192, 256, 320, 384}\n   - Aim ≥25 imgs/s (prefer 35–60).\n4) If <25 imgs/s, switch image encoder to ONNX Runtime (then optionally quantize). Reprofile.\n5) If still tight, set input size to 192, keep single image/product.\n6) Run full inference (SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS=None). Ensure no defaults in submission.\n\nThis path maximizes accuracy, ensures you finish, and preserves medal chances.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Prioritize a full, correct run now, then add supervision or a stronger zero-shot pipeline to reach ≥0.71.\n\n- Fix execution immediately\n  - Set SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS=None and run full inference; stop submitting partials.\n  - Verify schema: doc['imgs'] list with each dict['picture'] bytes.\n  - Ensure submission.csv matches sample order (_id, category_id), no fallbacks for products with images.\n\n- Strengthen the pipeline (zero-shot path)\n  - Full hierarchy: predict L1 → L2 → L3 using category_names.csv; cache text embeds for L1, L2, L3 and build L1→L2→L3 child maps.\n  - Prompts: expand to 20–40 FR/EN templates; include “produit/product/article/catalog/packshot” variants; average normalized logits across templates.\n  - Multi-image aggregation: compute both mean and max over per-image logits; blend (e.g., 0.5 mean + 0.5 max) per product.\n  - Calibration: apply classifier-free or per-template centering before averaging; keep L2-normalization and logit scaling.\n  - Lightweight ensemble: combine RN50 (CPU-fast) with a small ViT-B/32 head; average normalized model logits. Add TTA (horizontal flip) if throughput allows.\n\n- Throughput and stability (CPU-only)\n  - Use RN50; BATCH_IMAGES 128–256; torch.set_num_threads to cores, interop 1; model.eval(), no grads.\n  - Cache all text embeddings; process images batched across products; save partial predictions periodically.\n  - Consider ONNX Runtime for image encoder (1.5–3x CPU speedup). Avoid fp16 on CPU.\n  - Profile on ~2000 products; target ≥10 imgs/s; reduce templates or batch size if slow.\n\n- For medal-level accuracy, add supervision\n  - Best path: get train.bson (or any permissible labeled subset). Extract RN50 embeddings, then train a linear/logistic head or k-NN on CPU; infer test, then apply hierarchy constraints. This is the most reliable route to ≥0.71.\n  - If no labels available: use self-training—run zero-shot, select high-confidence predictions, fine-tune a linear head (or k-NN) on pseudo-labels; iterate.\n  - Apply mild class priors at L1/L2 if estimable; avoid over-bias.\n\n- Common pitfalls to avoid\n  - Flat 5,270-way zero-shot; too few prompts; English-only prompts.\n  - Not aggregating multi-images; excessive fallbacks for missing images.\n  - Threading misconfig, giant batches on CPU, not caching text embeds.\n  - Submission format/order mismatches.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Now: Finish text embeds (L1/L2/L3), switch to L1→L2→L3 scoring, set SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS=None, run full inference; add flip TTA if time permits; validate submission format.\n- Next: Boost with more prompts, mean+max aggregation, calibration, RN50+ViT-B/32 ensemble, ONNX Runtime for speed.\n- Medal push: Train a linear head (or k-NN) on any available labels (preferred) or pseudo-labels; then re-infer with hierarchy."

    "llm_json": "**Adjusting image processing**\n\nIn Cell 2, it’s currently set to 12, while experts recommend between 18 to 24. I think I can change that to 24. I also need to decide on preprocessing speed—should I disable antialiasing and use bilinear? Modifying the clip may be tricky. For now, I can implement the largest image per product and keep the batch size tuning at 256. During streaming, I’ll select the largest image for each product and process that efficiently. I'll need to update the loop to find and append the largest picture as a tensor.**Implementing L1 top-k feature**\n\nI need to modify the hierarchical score to obtain the top-k indices for L1, specifically k=2. The plan is to run a loop for each product where I'll compute the similarity scores, gather the top-k indices, and then gather the union of child nodes. This can be tricky since building different child sets for each product might complicate things. I’ll also set up logging to count images processed and maintain the image count since we’re processing one image per product. Lastly, I should improve the fallback submission logic to ensure we’re using proper scoring.**Planning for fallback mechanisms**\n\nI see that experts recommend using L1 and the best child options when images aren't available, but we lack that feature. Without image features, it seems like we might need to revert to a fallback class based on commonality. However, I should definitely avoid defaults. I'll set the SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS to 2000 for profiling as requested and update the thread settings in Cell 1, while changing the number of threads in Cell 2 to 24. Additionally, I might implement extra prompt templates later on, so I’ll need to edit Cells 1, 2, and 3 accordingly.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 3,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Inference: stream test.bson, encode images, score vs text (hierarchical with L1 top-k), and build submission\",\n      \"import bson\",\n      \"from io import BytesIO\",\n      \"from PIL import Image, UnidentifiedImageError\",\n      \"import pandas as pd, numpy as np, torch, time, sys, collections\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# CPU-friendly knobs\",\n      \"SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS = 2000   #

It still references 'product_id', which we thought we fixed to use '_id' instead. The output is showing the error from line 49, indicating the modified code hasn't updated as expected. It says the cell was modified since the last run, so executing it again should help clear the error. I've noted that Cell 2 ran despite the error from Cell 1.**Preparing to run cells**\n\nIt seems Cell 3 was modified, but it still shows an older output that indicates it stopped after 300 products. This hints that the earlier code used `SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS` set to 300, while we've now modified it to 2000. I need to run Cell 3 to profile throughput and calculate the images per second. I've confirmed that necessary variables from Cell 2 exist in the kernel. Now, I'll execute Cell 1 to update the threading environment before moving on to Cell 3.**Executing cells for setup**\n\nI should first run Cell 1 to clear any errors and set up the environment. This is important before moving on to Cell 3. So, in this turn, I’ll execute Cell 1 using the command that targets notebook_cell_index 1.

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating performance and next steps**\n\nI achieved 58.6 imgs/s on the profile using the largest image with the RN50 model, which exceeds the target of 25. Next, I need to run full inference by setting SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS=None and consider adjusting the thread configuration. It makes sense to edit Cell 3 to set that parameter and add periodic save checkpoints. With the aim of processing 706,990 products at this speed, it should stay within a 24-hour timeframe. Periodic logging every 20k products will also help track progress.**Addressing thread error and future steps**\n\nI'm running into a potential thread error that says I can't set the number of interop threads once parallel work has begun, but that’s okay. I need to set SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS=None and run Cell 3. I might consider disabling antialias to speed things up, but the current performance is already good. I want to ensure that there are no fallback fills for missing images, especially since we’re using the largest image only. While the cell is running, it’s a good idea to request an expert review, even though we can only use one tool at a time. Let’s edit Cell 3 to set SUBSAMPLE_PRODUCTS=None and possibly increase log frequency to 10,000.**Planning for periodic saves**\n\nI think we should keep the log at 2000 predictions, but I’m considering whether we should save periodic partial predictions. While it might not be strictly necessary given the duration, it could be good practice. Writing periodic CSV chunks might be a bit heavy to assemble, so instead, I’m thinking of saving the prediction map every 50k to a pickle file, though that does add some code complexity.
