Simple month map; append “года” per training patterns.\n  - Decimal reading with comma vs dot; consistent with train (e.g., “три целых четырнадцать сотых” vs digit-spelling style).\n  - Handle <self>/sil exactly as in train for punctuation.\n\n- Pitfalls to avoid\n  - Mixing sentences across folds; using after in features; re-tokenizing; stripping/normalizing whitespace.\n  - Mishandling NBSP/NNBSP in numbers; normalize for keying but preserve original in identity candidate.\n  - Lowercasing outputs blindly; mismatched Unicode punctuation (hyphen -, en dash – , em dash —).\n  - Encoding/CSV issues: wrong order, extra columns, index=True, wrong encoding.\n\n- Inference and performance\n  - Precompute prev/next and regex buckets once.\n  - Implement backoff via successive left-joins (vectorized) or nested dict lookups with tuple keys; pre-pickle maps.\n  - Batch ambiguous rows to model; batch by class for efficiency.\n  - Use categoricals and 32-bit dtypes to control RAM.\n\n- Submission\n  - Easiest: merge predictions into ru_sample_submission_2 by id to ensure exact row order/headers; index=False, UTF-8.\n  - If sample has only “after” column, write exactly that with same row order as test.\n  - Validate: shape equals sample/test, no NaNs, all ids covered.\n\n- Execution plan (tight timeline)\n  1) Load/EDA; confirm schema, classes, OOV rate for (class,before) in test.\n  2) Build K1–K11 frequency maps; implement backoff cascade; identity fallback by class policy; CV with GroupKFold; first submission.\n  3) Implement regex buckets + candidate sets; train unified CatBoost on ambiguous cases; integrate; CV per class; submit.\n  4) Error analysis: focus DATE/TIME/MONEY/CARDINAL/ORDINAL; add targeted rules (ruble forms, months, decimals); resubmit.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: submit fast with a memorization+backoff baseline, nail the <self> majority class, add class-aware rules for Russian numbers/dates, and use grouped CV to avoid leakage.

I need to add code to create maps for backoff keys and a function for predictions on the dataframe. Then, I'll compute the accuracy quickly. For test predictions, I should merge the output with the sample format, creating the id as f\"{sentence_id}_{token_id}\". Since the test lacks class, I'll use keys without requiring a class, possibly inferring it.**Building efficient counts**\n\nI want to build counts for each key mapping to the most common values afterward. Given the dataset size of 9.5M, I need to be mindful of memory and time. I’ll compute each key using groupby on the relevant columns and count size. Then, I can pick the most frequent \"after\" for each key. My approach is to group by key and \"after,\" size it, sort by count descending, and drop duplicates. \n\nI’ll also derive previous and next columns in both train and test datasets while managing memory effectively by only retaining necessary columns.**Optimizing submission process**\n\nTo save time, I can consider doing a quick holdout or skipping cross-validation (CV) to go straight to submission. However, I know the directive calls for GroupKFold, and I realize adding CV might be costly. I think I could try a 2-fold CV on a subset to verify. \n\nFor now, I’ll create a baseline and focus on making the submission. I'll derive previous and next for all entries and build maps for relevant keys. Predictions for the test will involve iteratively merging with the dict DataFrames while ensuring the submission is formatted correctly.**Setting up submission DataFrame**\n\nI can go ahead and set the submission DataFrame with the \"id\" and \"after\" values, then sort it to match the sample order by merging with the sample to fill in the \"after\" column. I'll merge based on the \"id.\" \n\nNext, I'll add the code to log timing and implement everything in chunks to keep within the execution time limits. I realize that building groupbys on 9.5 million records with multiple keys may take a while, so I'll ensure to include progress prints.
