(2) Validate via sentence-level split CV. (3) If needed, add class-specific heuristics or a small gradient-boosted model for ambiguous keys.

Which key variants give best payoff given memory/training time: include prev/next tokens, position-in-sentence, and sentence id? 2) What are the most impactful class-specific shortcuts to add early (e.g., PLAIN/PLAIN_CASE identity, PUNCT -> exact punctuation, VERBATIM passthrough, MONEY/MEASURE patterns, DATE/TIME, CARDINAL/ORDINAL)? 3) Any known pitfalls with grouping by sentence id and maintaining token order for prediction, or with duplicate ids in test? 4) Recommended fast features for a tiny model on ambiguous keys: char n-grams, token length, digit/latin/cyrillic flags, surrounding classes, capitalization patterns? 5) Efficiency tips: preferred pandas groupby recipe and avoiding OOM with these datasets; whether to pre-hash keys; how to serialize mappings; and typical proportion of unseen keys in test. 6) Submission format gotchas for ru_test_2: confirm columns (id, before, after?, class, sentence_id?) and required output shape. Goal: reach >=0.976 quickly, then iterate. Advise on the fastest path to medal for this specific track.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "**Urgent Baseline (Next 3-4 Hours)**\nYour plan is sound, but you must execute immediately.\n1.  **Inspect Data:** Unzip and check `ru_sample_submission_2.csv` to confirm the required `id`, `after` format and row order.\n2.  **Build Baseline:** Implement a simple memorization map using `(semiotic_class, token)` as the key.\n3.  **Validate:** Use `GroupKFold` on `sentence_id` to create a reliable cross-validation score, preventing leakage from tokens in the same sentence.\n4.  **Submit:** Get a baseline submission on the leaderboard. This should score ≥0.97 and secure a position near the bronze medal threshold.\n\n**Core Architecture: Contextual Memorization & Backoff**\nThis is the path to a medal-winning score.\n*   **Critical Preprocessing:** Before creating context features, you must sort your data by `(sentence_id, id)` or `(sentence_id, token_position)`. Failure to do so will corrupt your context and invalidate your model.\n*   **Key Hierarchy & Backoff Logic:** Implement a single prediction function that attempts to find a match in the following order:\n    1.  `(class, token, prev_class, next_class)`: The most robust and highest-impact context key.\n    2.  `(class, token, prev_token, next_token)`: More specific but can be sparse. Best used with a whitelist of high-signal neighbor tokens (e.g., punctuation, units, 'г.').\n    3.  `(class, token)`: Your core baseline map.\n    4.  `(token)`: A final token-only map.\n    5.  Class-Aware Fallback Rule (see below).\n\n**High-Impact Improvement: Class-Aware Fallbacks**\nThis is essential for handling the 5-15% of contextual keys that will be unseen in the test set. A simple identity fallback is a critical error.\n*   **Safe Identity Fallback:** For unseen tokens in `PLAIN`, `PUNCT`, `VERBATIM`, and `LETTERS`, returning the input token is a safe and accurate strategy.\n*   **Rule-Based Fallbacks (High-ROI):**\n    *   **`CARDINAL`/`ORDINAL`:** Use a library like `num2words` (e.g., `num2words(token, lang='ru')`). This is the single biggest improvement over a simple baseline.\n    *   **`DATE`:** Use simple regex to parse common formats (e.g., `DD.MM.YYYY`, `YYYY`).\n    *   **`ELECTRONIC`/`TELEPHONE`:** Implement digit-by-digit expansion rules.\n\n**Advanced Technique (For Silver/Gold Push)**\nIf time permits and error analysis shows persistent ambiguity, train a small gradient-boosted model (LightGBM/CatBoost).\n*   **Scope:** Train only on the subset of keys with high conflict in the training data (e.g., where the most frequent label has <97% purity).\n*   **Features:** Use `prev/next_class`, character n-grams (1-4), token length, and boolean flags (`is_upper`, `has_digit`, `is_cyrillic`).\n\n**Key Implementation & Efficiency Notes**\n*   **Memory:** Use `dtype='category'` for string columns like `class` when loading data. Process in chunks if you face OOM errors.\n*   **Map Creation:** To build maps, use `df.groupby(keys)['after'].agg(lambda x: x.value_counts().index[0])`.\n*   **Serialization:** Save and load your mapping dictionaries using `pickle` for speed.\n*   **Submission:** Double-check that your final CSV has `id` and `after` columns, matching the exact row count and order of the test file.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Move from planning to execution immediately; produce a strong memorization baseline, validate ≥0.97592 CV, iterate only where errors concentrate.\n\nConcise plan\n- Status: Not on track—no code, no submission.csv, no score.\n- Target: CV accuracy ≥ 0.97592 (bronze), aim ≥0.98 to be safe.\n\nImmediate actions (next 1–2 hours)\n- Discover/load data: List files; load ru_train.csv(.zip), ru_test_2.csv(.zip); check/sample_submission.csv if present.\n- Confirm schema: Common cols = sentence_id, token_id, class, before, after (train has after; test lacks).\n- Add context: Sort by sentence_id, token_id; create prev_before and next_before via groupby shifts.\n\nBaseline: context-aware memorization with backoffs\n- Majority maps in priority:\n  1) (class, before, prev_before, next_before) → majority after\n  2) (class, before) → majority after\n  3) (before) → majority after\n  4) Fallback: identity (after = before). Special-cases: PLAIN/PUNCT/SELF/VERBATIM likely identity; SIL → “sil”.\n- Implementation tips: pandas groupby agg to get majority; store dicts; fast dict lookups at inference.\n\nValidation and success criteria\n- CV: Split by sentence_id; compute token-level accuracy.\n- Gate: Submit only if CV ≥ 0.97592; target ≥ 0.98.\n- Diagnose: Report errors by class and by backoff level hit rate.\n\nTargeted refinements (only if CV < target or class hotspots)\n- Russian specifics:\n  - Numbers: distinguish cardinal vs ordinal; handle inflection from context when possible.\n  - Dates/Times/Money/Measure: rely on memorization first; add tiny regex/rules for top frequent patterns (e.g., month names, case endings).\n  - Case/gender agreement: consider pymorphy2 if a few rules close major gaps.\n- Ambiguity resolver (light ML if needed):\n  - Train on ambiguous keys only (where multiple “after” values observed).\n  - Features: class, before, prev_before, next_before, char n-grams, is_digit/casing flags.\n  - Use CatBoost/LightGBM; keep it minimal.\n\nInference and submission\n- Apply lookup with backoffs to test; preserve ordering.\n- Output submission.csv with required columns (commonly id and after; id may be sentence_id_token_id).\n\nTime and efficiency\n- Baseline build: 30–60 minutes.\n- Prioritize quick iterations; log runs and error hotspots.\n- Avoid overcomplication early; rules/ML only for top error slices.\n\nRisks to avoid\n- Delaying baseline implementation.\n- Overfitting on small data—use sentence-level CV.\n- Spending time on low-impact rules before measuring baseline gaps."

    "llm_json": "**Planning implementation steps**\n\nI’m figuring out the next steps, like implementing baseline maps and computer vision. First, I need to add a code cell to load the full training data with specific data types. I'll build mappings for class and before majority, then use GroupKFold by sentence_id to compute accuracy with a prediction function that uses backoffs. I wonder if I'm focusing on speed first by implementing simple mappings and ensuring evaluation happens on validation. I'll implement several functions to organize everything as needed.**Evaluating with GroupKFold**\n\nI need to use GroupKFold for my evaluation. First, I'll loop through the folds to build maps using just the training fold, then predict on the validation fold and compute accuracy. However, I’ve realized that the test set only contains before tokens and IDs, without a class. That’s a critical issue! I can't rely on class-based mappings for the baseline. Instead, I should use token-only mapping across all classes and consider using the surrounding tokens for context. Training a classifier to predict the class for the test might be a bit too heavy.**Mapping token identity**\n\nI’m considering that many tokens map to identity, except for special classes that often have spaces in the 'before' text, like \"1862 год\" for the DATE class in training. The test set may also include tokens with spaces. So, I think I should compute mappings based on token-only and surrounding tokens. I plan to build maps using combinations of 'before', 'prev_before', and 'next_before' to find the most frequent 'after' token. I need to ensure my memory is optimized since the training data could be millions of rows long!**Implementing GroupKFold**\n\nI’m planning to implement CV GroupKFold by sentence_id while using context from neighboring tokens. To start, I might focus on a simpler mapping from (before) to after for quicker CV. Afterward, I need to set up the submission format as \"sentence_token,\" like \"0_0.\" My next step will involve creating a code cell to load the full training and testing datasets, sort them, and add the prev_before and next_before tokens. Then, I'll build maps and perform CV with 5 folds to log accuracy and backoff usage. Finally, I’ll predict on the test data and construct the submission file.

By using the size function and picking the index of the maximum per group, I can speed things up. Instead of using lambda for each group, I'll aggregate counts and build a mapping that way.

I might aim for a simpler map focusing on tokens first to maintain accuracy without overload.**Adjusting the strategy for counts**\n\nI can only utilize the \"before\" strings for my analysis. I’m considering focusing on combinations like (before, prev_before) and (before, next_before), or even (before, prev, next) but need to prioritize building counts efficiently.

I’m considering using `pandas.value_counts` on the 'before' column, paired with `groupby` and `agg`, but that feels heavy. An alternative is to read the train data in chunks and create a dictionary of frequent pairs using hashing. Although our train is one massive ZIP CSV, `pandas.read_csv` supports chunksize, which makes this more manageable. Tracking most frequent pairs on the fly could save memory.**Optimizing counting with pandas**\n\nTo pinpoint the top items, I can use a Counter that updates incrementally, which should be manageable since the unique 'before' values might only be a few million out of 9.5M rows. However, it could still get heavy. Instead, I could leverage pandas to compute `value_counts` on 'before' and 'after' in chunks. I can maintain a `defaultdict(Counter)` for mapping before to after. I can also read the test set once to get unique 'before' values, then count only the relevant rows while processing train data in chunks. This should significantly improve efficiency.**Implementing the final steps**\n\nI’m ready to pick the top 'after' per 'before' and apply that to the test, using a fallback identity if needed. First, I’ll create a new cell for this. Then, I'll use the chunked approach with the same dtype as before, and I'll make sure to print the progress as I go.

A possible lightweight method is to use Python's zipfile for reading inner CSVs, though pd.read_csv should work too. The test zip has 1,059,191 rows and about 70MB, so I’ll check if reading it causes issues. Alternatively, I could just copy the sample submission file, which aligns with test rows and columns.

Copying it is the quickest route and avoids handling the large test zip file. I'll implement a simple method to extract the sample submission zip. Though it has the same row count, it only has two columns. Instead of reading it fully, I can use zipfile.ZipFile to get the file bytes and write them directly to submission.csv.

Strangely, there were no outputs, even the initial \"Loading test...\" in cell 6. Maybe the kernel was busy? I wonder if using SQLite or Polars could speed things up. Both options look promising!**Exploring data handling options**\n\nI’m considering whether Polars can read zipped files. It definitely supports gzip and zstd, but I'm unsure about zip. I could use Python's zipfile to access the inner CSV bytes and pass that to Polars through BytesIO. Given the train size is unknown but probably around 1.3GB uncompressed, my 234GB RAM should handle it just fine. Alternatively, I could use pandas to filter the train data for the test set before merging, but that would require reading the entire train set. Chunked counting in cell 6 seems promising!**Planning data extraction**\n\nI think I encountered an issue with reading the zipped file in chunks using pandas. It seems that pandas can't handle compressed files in chunks efficiently since it loads the entire file into memory. That must be why there's been no progress; it’s trying to read the whole zip for the first chunk. I’ll unzip the CSV to a temporary file first, then read it in chunks.

    "llm_json": "**Implementing streaming CSV reader**\n\nI'm thinking about how to implement a streaming CSV reader with pandas, using a chunksize of around 2 million rows. To handle the \"next\" row within the same sentence, I can peek at the next buffered row while processing the current one. I need to make sure I carry the last row of the previous chunk to manage any sentences that continue into the next chunk, especially since sentence boundaries can be tricky with longer data.**Simplifying context loading**\n\nI'm considering a simpler, more robust approach for loading data to add context efficiently. Previous methods attempted to load a full zip with dtype, which was fast but slowed down groupby operations for mapping. I think loading the uncompressed ru_train.csv with specific columns will streamline memory usage. I'll sort by 'sentence_id' and 'token_id', create previous/next relationships using groupby shift, and filter rows based on what's in my test set to compute counts for triplets only in relevant contexts.**Processing context for counts**\n\nWhile I'm processing the training data, I need to compute the context for each row and only increment counts if that context is in the designated set. This approach avoids using groupby. I plan to read the training data in chunks and generate previous/next relationships using shifts, while managing carryover rows across chunks per sentence. It might be more efficient to load the entire train_csv into memory, given our ample RAM, and then build counts from the contexts found in the test sets using a vectorized approach.**Creating composite keys for triples**\n\nTo match triples against exact sets, I can create composite key strings like \"before|||prev|||next\" and then use Series value_counts on these keys after filtering to include only those present in the test set. First, I need to identify which keys to retain by building a set of test triple keys. The plan involves creating a test DataFrame with prev/next columns, then setting up my sets: triples_set, pair_prev_set, pair_next_set, and confirming the unigram set is already completed.**Computing triple and pair counts**\n\nWe're ready to calculate triple and pair counts now that we have the unigram. I’ll load train.csv with selected columns and add context for previous and next tokens using groupby shifts. To boost efficiency, I’ll restrict the data we're working with to rows where 'before' is in the test set and at least one context matches. For triples, I'll create a key from 'before', 'prev', and 'next', then establish mappings and counts efficiently using groupby and value_counts, ensuring we maintain a backoff order for predictions. I'll implement this in cell 10.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_notebook\",\n  \"filepath\": \"main.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"action\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"cell_index\": 10,\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Contextual memorization with backoffs: (before, prev, next) -> (before, prev) -> (before, next) -> unigram -> identity\",\n      \"import pandas as pd, numpy as np, time, os\",\n      \"\",\n      \"t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"train_csv = 'ru_train.csv'  # uncompressed from previous step\",\n      \"test_zip = 'ru_test_2.csv.zip'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def add_context(df):\",\n      \"    df = df.sort_values(['sentence_id','token_id']).copy()\",\n      \"    df['prev_before'] = df.groupby('sentence_id', observed=True)['before'].shift(1).fillna('\\u27c2')\",\n      \"    df['next_before'] = df.groupby('sentence_id', observed=True)['before'].shift(-1).fillna('\\u27c2')\",\n      \"    return df\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('Loading test and adding context...')\",\n      \"dtype_test = {'sentence_id':'int32','token_id':'int32','before':'string'}\",\n      \"test = pd.read_csv(test_zip, dtype=dtype_test)\",\n      \"test = add_context(test)\",\n      \"print('Test ready:', test.shape)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Build key sets from test\",\n      \"print('Building test key sets...')\",\n      \"test['k_tri'] = (test['before'] + '\\\\t' + test['prev_before'] + '\\\\t' + test['next_before']).astype('string')\",\n      \"test['k_bp']  = (test['before'] + '\\\\t' + test['prev_before']).astype('string')\",\n      \"test['k_bn']  = (test['before'] + '\\\\t' + test['next_before']).astype('string')\",\n      \"tri_set = set(pd.unique(test['k_tri']))\",\n      \"bp_set  = set(pd.unique(test['k_bp']))\",\n      \"bn_set  = set(pd.unique(test['k_bn']))\",\n      \"print('Unique test keys -> tri:', len(tri_set), 'bp:', len(bp_set), 'bn:', len(bn_set))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('Loading full train (uncompressed) minimal cols and adding context...')\",\n      \"dtype_train = {'sentence_id':'int32','token_id':'int32','before':'string','after':'string'}\",\n      \"train = pd.read_csv(train_csv, dtype=dtype_train, usecols=['sentence_id','token_id','before','after'])\",\n      \"train = add_context(train)\",\n      \"print('Train ready:', train.shape, 'Elapsed:', f'{time.time()-t0:.1f}s')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Compose keys in train\",\n      \"print('Composing train keys...')\",\n      \"t1 = time.time()\",\n      \"train['k_tri'] = (train['before'] + '\\\\t' + train['prev_before'] + '\\\\t' + train['next_before']).astype('string')\",\n      \"train['k_bp']  = (train['before'] + '\\\\t' + train['prev_before']).astype('string')\",\n      \"train['k_bn']  = (train['before'] + '\\\\t' + train['next_before']).astype('string')\",\n      \"print('Keys composed in', f'{time.time()-t1:.1f}s')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Filter rows that can hit any test key\",\n      \"print('Filtering candidate rows...')\",\n      \"t2 = time.time()\",\n      \"mask = train['k_tri'].isin(tri_set) | train['k_bp'].isin(bp_set) | train['k_bn'].isin(bn_set)\",\n      \"cand = train.loc[mask, ['after','k_tri','k_bp','k_bn']]\",\n      \"print('Candidates:', cand.shape, 'filter time:', f'{time.time()-t2:.1f}s')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def build_top_map(df, key_col):\",\n      \"    if df.empty: return {}\",\n      \"    grp = df.groupby([key_col, 'after'], observed=True).size().reset_index(name='cnt')\",\n      \"    grp.sort_values([key_col, 'cnt'], ascending=[True, False], inplace=True)\",\n      \"    top = grp.drop_duplicates(subset=[key_col], keep='first')\",\n      \"    return dict(zip(top[key_col].array, top['after'].array))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"print('Building maps...')\",\n      \"t3 = time.time()\",\n      \"map_tri = build_top_map(cand[['k_tri','after']].rename(columns={'k_tri':'key'}), 'key') if not cand.empty else {}\",\n      \"map_bp  = build_top_map(cand[['k_bp','after']].rename(columns={'k_bp':'key'}), 'key') if not cand.empty else {}\",\n      \"map_bn  = build_top_map(cand[['k_bn','after']].rename(columns={'k_bn':'key'}), 'key') if not cand.empty else {}\",\n      \"print(f'Maps built in {time.time()-t3:.1f}s | tri={len(map_tri):,} bp={len(map_bp):,} bn={len(map_bn):,}')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Optional: unigram map (fallback).
