Key questions to medal fast on CHAMPS: 1) Validation: Confirm GroupKFold by molecule_name is standard; should I stratify per coupling type (stratified group kfold) or train per-type with independent folds? 2) Features to reach bronze quickly without quantum chemistry aux tables: From structures.csv only, what minimal geometry set gets strong CV? (e.g., interatomic distance, xyz deltas, atomic numbers, one-hot bond type, nearest-neighbor distances for each atom, angles/dihedrals using kNN, counts of neighbors within radii). Which 10\\u201320 features are must-haves? 3) Data leakage: The aux files (mulliken_charges, magnetic_shielding_tensors, dipole_moments, potential_energy, scalar_coupling_contributions) exist mostly for train. Should I completely avoid merging them to prevent train/test mismatch? Any safe aggregates at molecule level that won\\u2019t leak? 4) Modeling: Per coupling type models with CatBoost/XGBoost on GPU\\u2014any preference for this competition? Typical winning params (depth, lr, l2, min_child_weight, subsample, colsample) and rounds with early stopping? Suggested handling of categorical variables (type, atom symbols) with CatBoost vs one-hot for XGB? 5) Efficiency: Recommended pipeline to compute geometry fast for 463k rows and 76k structure files? (e.g., load structures.csv once, map to arrays, compute pairwise distances only for pairs listed in train/test, cache features to feather/parquet). 6) CV metric: Best practice for computing overall log-MAE by type weighting; should I compute per type MAE and log then average, or log of global MAE? 7) Pitfalls: Common mistakes that tank LB (e.g., mixing train/test info when computing neighbor stats, incorrect molecule grouping, extrapolation on test types). 8) Quick baseline recipe to reach ~bronze: exact feature list + model choice + CV setup that you\\u2019ve seen reliably hit ~ -1.9 log-MAE in a few hours.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a concise, medal-focused synthesis pulling the best guidance from all four audits, mapped to your questions and your current plan.\n\n1) Validation\n- Use GroupKFold by molecule_name. Non-negotiable.\n- Train separate models per coupling type. No need to stratify; just reuse the same molecule-based folds and filter by type inside each loop.\n- Save fold indices early and reuse for all types/experiments.\n\n2) Minimal features (structures.csv only) that work fast\nAim for 10–20 high-ROI features per row (molecule, atom_index_0, atom_index_1, type):\nCore pair features\n- r = Euclidean distance between atom0 and atom1 (king feature)\n- dx, dy, dz; r2; 1/r; 1/r2 (and optionally 1/r3)\n- Z0, Z1 (atomic numbers); Z_sum, Z_diff, Z_min, Z_max\n- Same_element flag (Z0 == Z1)\n- J-order from type: 1/2/3 (e.g., 1JHC -> 1, 2JHH -> 2) as integer feature\nAtom environment (per atom)\n- Nearest-neighbor distances: d_min, d_mean, d_max among k=3 neighbors (exclude the paired atom)\n- Neighbor counts within radii: cnt_r15 and cnt_r20 (1.5 Å, 2.0 Å)\nSimple angle proxies (important for 2J/3J)\n- cos(theta0): angle between vector (0→1) and (0→k0) where k0 is atom0’s nearest neighbor ≠ atom1\n- cos(theta1): same for atom1\nMolecule-level\n- n_atoms in molecule\n- Element counts or fractions for C/H/N/O/F (e.g., frac_C, frac_H)\nOptional (add if time allows)\n- Dihedral cosines for 3J via nearest neighbor chain\n- Distance to molecule centroid for each atom\nThis set (through angles and neighbor counts) is enough for ~bronze.\n\n3) Data leakage and aux tables\n- Skip all aux tables (mulliken_charges, magnetic_shielding_tensors, dipole_moments, potential_energy, scalar_coupling_contributions). Test lacks them and you will leak; contributions directly encode the target.\n- Safe features = anything derived solely from structures.csv and the pair list in train/test. Do not compute any train-aggregated stat and map to test.\n\n4) Modeling\n- Train one model per coupling type.\n- Fast/strong choices:\n  CatBoost (GPU)\n  - depth 6–8, learning_rate 0.05–0.08, l2_leaf_reg 5, subsample 0.8, iterations up to 3000–5000, early_stopping_rounds 100–200, eval_metric MAE\n  - If per-type with numeric features (Z, geometry), you can skip categoricals. If using symbols/types globally, mark as categorical.\n  LightGBM (CPU/GPU)\n  - objective regression_l1 (MAE), num_leaves 64–128, max_depth 7–10, learning_rate 0.03–0.05, feature_fraction 0.8, bagging_fraction 0.8, min_child_samples 10, reg_alpha=0.1, reg_lambda=0.1, n_estimators 3000–5000, early_stopping 100–200\n  XGBoost (GPU)\n  - tree_method=gpu_hist, max_depth 7, eta 0.05, subsample 0.8, colsample_bytree 0.8, min_child_weight 10–20, reg_lambda 1.0, nrounds up to 5000 with early stopping\n- Any of the three can hit bronze; CatBoost for simplicity with categoricals, LGBM for speed, XGB for reliable GPU.\n\n5) Efficient geometry pipeline\n- Load structures.csv once; build per-molecule arrays: atom_index, Z (int16), coords (float32).\n- For each molecule, build a cKDTree/KDTree for neighbors and cache per-molecule kNN/radius results.\n- Compute features only for the listed pairs in train/test (no full pairwise matrices).\n- Process grouped by molecule to vectorize within-group; avoid row-wise Python loops.\n- Cache features to feather/parquet per type (float32/int16). Reuse for CV and test. Parallelize by molecule with joblib/multiprocessing.\n\n6) CV metric (group mean log-MAE)\n- Correct formula: compute MAE per type on OOF; take log of each type’s MAE; average the logs. Do not log global MAE.\n\n7) Pitfalls that tank LB\n- Any CV not grouped by molecule_name.\n- Using aux tables or any statistic built using train that’s mapped to test.\n- Computing neighbor stats mixing train+test context; only use structures per molecule, independent of split.\n- Wrong handling of atom0/atom1 ordering; keep consistent definitions for directional features.\n- Including type as a feature in per-type models (it’s constant).\n- Slow FE without caching; angle/dihedral overengineering that blows runtime.\n\n8) Quick bronze baseline (often ~ -1.9 log-MAE in a few hours)\n- CV: 5-fold GroupKFold by molecule_name; save splits. Train per type.\n- Features: distance + inverses, deltas, Z features, J-order, k=3 NN distances (min/mean/max) and counts within 1.5/2.0 Å, cos(angle) proxies, molecule n_atoms and element fractions.\n- Model: CatBoost GPU or LightGBM as above. Early stopping 100–200.\n- Pipeline: compute/cache features → per-type CV with OOF → compute group-mean log-MAE → predict test per type and concat.\n- Start with 2-fold smoke on 10% molecules to validate runtime and metric, then scale to full 5-fold.\n\nAdjustments to your current notebook plan\n- In step 4, drop “link aux tables” entirely for baseline; revisit only after you have a solid CV/LB and only with non-leaky, structures-derived proxies.\n- Keep features numeric and compact (float32). Cache aggressively.\n- After FE v1 (distance, deltas, Z) confirm CV; FE v2 adds kNN counts and angle proxies; skip heavy dihedrals unless time remains.\n\nThis path is safe, fast, and repeatedly achieved ~bronze without aux data.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: pivot to per-type, geometry-first models with strict GroupKFold, add OOF-proxied quantum features, and blend strong learners.\n\n- Immediate triage\n  - Sanity-check data/submit: correct merges, per-type means as a quick baseline, valid submission (id order, no NaNs). If type-mean baseline isn’t ≈ -0.0 to -0.5, fix pipelines.\n  - Switch NOW to per-coupling-type training and scoring.\n\n- Validation and metric\n  - GroupKFold by molecule_name (5–10 folds), stratified by coupling type if needed for balance.\n  - Compute official metric: mean over types of log(MAE_type). Track per-type OOF and overall.\n  - Use OOF predictions for any stacking/blending and for aux-feature proxies.\n\n- Feature engineering (priority order)\n  - Core geometry (from structures):\n    - Pair distance d, dx/dy/dz, 1/d, 1/d^2, 1/d^3.\n    - Atomic numbers and per-atom one-hots.\n  - Local environment:\n    - kNN neighbors (k=1–4) per atom: distances, min/mean/max/std, sums of 1/d^n, element counts; counts within radii (e.g., 1.2/1.5/2.0 Å).\n    - Angles to neighbors; sin/cos; dihedrals using nearest neighbors on the coupling path.\n    - Environment contrasts: sums/diffs between the two atoms for all aggregates.\n  - Graph/path features:\n    - Shortest path length, number/type of bonds along path, ring membership/size, local topology indicators.\n  - Chemical domain:\n    - Electronegativity diffs, hybridization (sp/sp2/sp3), aromaticity, functional group flags; Karplus-inspired dihedral terms for 3J types.\n  - Auxiliary quantum data (if available):\n    - Build separate models per aux target (Mulliken, shielding eigs/trace, dipole, potential energy) using pure geometry; create OOF predictions (train) and test preds; use these preds as features in the main models. Do not use raw aux values directly in main training to avoid distribution shift.\n\n- Modeling and ensembling\n  - Per-type gradient boosting as backbone:\n    - LightGBM (GPU) and/or CatBoost; early stopping; typical LGBM ranges: num_leaves 63–127, lr 0.03–0.06, n_estimators 5k–15k, feature/bagging_fraction 0.7–0.9, min_data_in_leaf 50–200, lambda_l2 1–5.\n  - Add diversity:\n    - Kernel Ridge Regression per type (RBF/Laplacian) on standardized geometry features; tune alpha/gamma by CV.\n    - Optional small MLP per type on standardized features.\n  - Blend:\n    - Per-type linear blender (ridge/Lasso) on OOF preds to combine LGBM/CatBoost/KRR; apply to test preds.\n  - Post-process:\n    - Clip predictions to train min/max per type to curb outliers.\n\n- Workflow, speed, and QA\n  - GPU acceleration; batch FE; log experiments (FE version, params, per-type OOF).\n  - Fold-only feature generation to prevent leakage; never cross molecules across folds.\n  - Sanity checks: prediction distributions per type resemble train; top importances include distance, 1/d^n, angles/dihedrals, neighbor aggregates.\n\n- Targets and milestones\n  - Baseline per-type GBDT with core geometry should reach ~ -1.0 quickly.\n  - With neighbors/angles/dihedrals/graph features and strict CV: push to ≤ -1.5.\n  - Add OOF-proxied aux features + KRR + blending to reach bronze (≤ -1.90122)."
