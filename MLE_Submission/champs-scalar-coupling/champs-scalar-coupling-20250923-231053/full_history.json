Best practices recommend getting an expert review after creating a plan, so I should do that at major workflow checkpoints. I think the next step is to request expert advice on our plan and medal strategies. Plus, checking the environment is essential. Starting with `nvidia-smi` is suggested, so I’ll execute that after creating the code cell.**Requesting expert input**\n\nI think it’s a good idea to request expert guidance on known good features for CHAMPS, such as distance, angles, bond types, atom environments, and graph path lengths. For our models, I want to ensure validation involves grouping by molecule name, possibly stratified by type using additional data files. I'm cautious about target leaks, especially using test contributions. I can train models per type, leveraging features like structures, tensors, and potential energy. Let’s ask for more expert insight on this!**Requesting expert review**\n\nI'm planning to use the `request_expert_review` function with the filepath `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb`. I want to include specific questions about confirming cross-validation, feature sets, and modeling choices like XGB or CatBoost for each type. I also need guidance on how to handle large structure files (*.xyz) since I have a `structures.csv` that includes positions. So, yes, let's go ahead and request that expert review!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint A: Plan + strategy validation before coding.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a unified, CHAMPS‑specific action plan synthesizing all four reviews. Keep it tight, lock CV early, and iterate features in the order below.\n\n1) CV (correct approach + traps)\n- Use GroupKFold by molecule_name (5 folds). Aim for similar coupling_type mix per fold (stratify within groups if you can; otherwise monitor and rebalance).\n- Safe workflow:\n  - Pre-merge fold‑agnostic, test‑available atom tables once: structures (coords, element), static periodic props (covalent radius, EN), dipoles, potential_energy. Cache.\n  - Any statistics or transforms derived from train‑only tables (mulliken, shieldings, any per-molecule/per-element aggregates) must be computed inside each fold using only fold‑train molecules and then applied to fold‑val/test. Cache per‑fold features.\n- Always join pair rows on (molecule_name, atom_index_0/1). Never compute molecule‑level aggregates globally.\n\n2) Feature priorities (fast path to medal)\n- Tier 1 (do first; biggest lift):\n  - Geometry: distance d, 1/d, 1/d^2, 1/d^3, d^2.\n  - Atom identity: sym0, sym1; pair code (sym0_sym1), same_element flag; periodic props (r_cov, EN, period/group) for each atom + sums/diffs.\n  - Graph core: infer bonds via distance < k*(r_cov_i+r_cov_j) (k≈1.1); features: is_bonded, shortest_path_len (clip 1–5), degrees of atom0/1, ring flag.\n  - Charges/Shieldings: mulliken charge (a0/a1, sum/diff), shielding isotropic (trace/3 for a0/a1, sum/diff).\n- Tier 2 (next; pushes to silver):\n  - Local angles: for each atom, nearest neighbor (excluding the partner) → angle NN0–A0–A1 and NN1–A1–A0; use cos(angle).\n  - Neighbor stats: bonded neighbor count; min/mean/max of first 3 neighbor distances; counts of neighbor element types.\n  - Molecule context: potential_energy, dipole norm/components; molecule atom count and element counts.\n- Tier 3 (for hard types, silver+):\n  - Karplus/dihedrals: dihedral along shortest 3‑bond path (critical for 3JHH; helpful for 3JHC/3JHN). Also include sin/cos terms and simple Karplus polynomial bases.\n  - Shielding anisotropy (lambda_max - lambda_min); per‑element z‑scores of charge/shielding within molecule (computed fold‑safe).\n- RDKit: optional later; not needed for v0/v1. If used, build bonds via thresholds carefully; adds small but real gains.\n\n3) Modeling (per‑type, still SOTA)\n- Train separate models for each coupling_type (8 models). Feature emphasis:\n  - 1J*: distance, is_bonded, degrees, element pair, charges/shieldings.\n  - 2J/3J: shortest_path_len, angles, ring flag, dihedral (for 3J).\n- Try XGBoost and CatBoost on GPU; blend by per‑type OOF. Use feature importance to prune per‑type.\n\n4) Leakage\n- Do NOT use scalar_coupling_contributions (FC/SD/PSO/DSO) as features (train‑only; direct target leak).\n- Safe: mulliken, magnetic_shielding_tensors, potential_energy, dipoles (train/test provided).\n- If you ever use contributions, only as auxiliary targets in a separate multi‑task setup; otherwise skip.\n\n5) Fast baseline hyperparams (GPU)\n- XGBoost:\n  - tree_method=gpu_hist, objective=reg:squarederror, eval_metric=mae\n  - max_depth 7–9 (shallower for sparse types), min_child_weight 8–20, subsample 0.8, colsample_bytree 0.8, eta 0.05–0.1\n  - n_estimators up to 2000–3000 with early_stopping_rounds 100–200\n- CatBoost:\n  - task_type=GPU, loss_function=RMSE, depth=8, learning_rate=0.05, l2_leaf_reg≈6, iterations up to 3000, early_stopping_rounds 200\n- Expect deeper trees / lower lr for 3J*, simpler for 1J*.\n\n6) Error buckets + needle movers\n- Easiest: 1JHC, 1JHN. Hardest: 3JHH, 3JHC (dihedrals, ring/paths).\n- Biggest gains by type:\n  - 1J*: distance/inverses, is_bonded, charges/shieldings.\n  - 2J*: angles + path length.\n  - 3J*: dihedral/Karplus + path features; ring flag helps.\n- Track official metric: mean(log(MAE) per type). Monitor per‑type OOF MAE and by distance/path bins.\n\n7) Runtime (A10 24GB)\n- Dev: 3 folds, ≤1200 trees, ES 100 → ~20–30 min all types once features cached.\n- Final: 5 folds, ≤2000–3000 trees, ES 100–200 → ~45–60 min per model family. Train XGB first, then CatBoost; blend.\n- Cache:\n  - Atom table (coords, props) once.\n  - Per‑molecule graphs and neighbor lists once (from structures only).\n  - Fold‑safe features (charges/shieldings aggregates) per fold.\n\n8) Common pitfalls\n- Wrong joins: must use (molecule_name, atom_index_[0/1]) with suffixes; beware 0‑based indices.\n- Fold leakage via global aggregates or using train‑only info to compute per‑molecule stats outside folds.\n- Angle/dihedral bugs (degrees vs radians); use radians and provide sin/cos.\n- Metric mismatch: don’t optimize overall MAE; use competition LogMAE.\n- Bond inference thresholds too tight/loose; validate degree distributions and path lengths.\n- Memory: downcast to float32/int32; categorical encode symbols.\n\nMinimal rollout to reach silver with trees\n- v0 (baseline): distance/inverses/squares; sym0/sym1 + periodic props (sums/diffs); is_bonded; shortest_path_len; degrees; ring flag; mulliken and shielding iso (a0/a1, sum/diff); molecule context; neighbor counts and NN distance stats. Train per‑type XGB.\n- v1: add nearest‑neighbor angles (cos); path‑aware features (heteroatoms count on path, max EN jump).\n- v2 (hard types): dihedral and Karplus bases for pairs with path_len≥3; shielding anisotropy; per‑element z‑scores.\n\nEdits to your notebook plan\n- Remove “Add high‑signal features from contributions (FC/SD/PSO/DSO)” as features. Note explicitly: train‑only; not used as features. Optional: future auxiliary targets only.\n- State metric as mean log(MAE) per type and report per‑type OOF.\n- Lock a single fold split and seed; cache all features.\n\nIf you want, I can provide pseudocode for: bond graph construction, shortest path per pair, nearest‑neighbor angle, and dihedral/Karplus.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal:\n- Immediate priorities (today)\n  - Fix CV: GroupKFold by molecule_name, 5–10 folds; ensure each fold has all coupling types; set seed.\n  - Implement local metric: mean over coupling types of log(MAE_type + 1e-9) on OOF.\n  - Sanity baseline: per-type median (or simple distance-only LightGBM) and submit to validate pipeline and format.\n\n- Core pipeline (this week)\n  - Per-type models only (1J, 2J, 3J variants separately).\n  - Geometry+graph features from structures (train/test parity guaranteed; all transforms fit inside folds):\n    - Distances: d, d^2, 1/d, 1/d^2, 1/d^3; log(d).\n    - Atom descriptors: atomic number/type, electronegativity, covalent radii, valence electrons; sums/diffs/ratios across the pair.\n    - Molecular graph via covalent cutoff; shortest-path length between the two atoms; node degree; ring/aromatic flags; neighbor element histograms.\n    - Local environment: neighbor counts within radii (by element), min/mean/max neighbor distances; unit-vector dot/cross features.\n    - Angles: i–k–j angles (stats over k-neighbors).\n    - Torsions/dihedrals along shortest path; for 3J types add Karplus features: cos(phi), cos^2(phi).\n  - Models: start with LightGBM and CatBoost (GPU if available), plus XGBoost as a third blender.\n    - Typical params: depth 6–10, lr 0.02–0.05, 5k–20k iters with early stopping, subsample/colsample 0.7–0.9.\n  - Ensembling: OOF-weighted blend per type (LGBM + CatBoost + XGB). Add different seeds for 5–10% gain.\n\n- Type-specific emphasis (big lifts)\n  - 1J (direct bond): distance, charges/electronegativity diffs, local environment.\n  - 2J: add bond angle features (geminal angles).\n  - 3J: dihedral angles are critical; Karplus terms drive most of the gain.\n\n- Two-stage stacking (if needed to push past bronze)\n  - Stage A (no leakage): train per-atom models to predict Mulliken charges and shielding tensor components using geometry/graph features; generate OOF preds for train and preds for test.\n  - Aggregate Stage A preds to pair-level features (sum/diff around the pair, neighbor aggregates).\n  - Stage B: optional per-type models for FC/SD/PSO/DSO contributions from geometry + Stage A preds; sum predicted contributions; blend with direct scalar model.\n  - Train Stage B on OOF predictions only (fold-wise) to avoid leakage.\n\n- Validation, diagnostics, and submission\n  - Track OOF logMAE by type; prioritize the worst type (often 3J) with targeted features (dihedrals).\n  - Clip extreme predictions per type if outliers dominate errors.\n  - Submission: columns = id, scalar_coupling_constant; row count must match test.\n\n- Common pitfalls to avoid\n  - Leakage: any molecule-level aggregates, scalers, or auxiliary targets must be fit inside folds; never use test data in FE; no direct use of train-only quantum files on test.\n  - Single model across all types.\n  - Wrong metric or random CV splits.\n  - Overfitting on small data: use strong regularization and early stopping.\n\n- Minimal milestone plan\n  - A–B: Env check + data audit + finalized GroupKFold + local metric.\n  - C: Geometry+graph FE v0; per-type LightGBM/CatBoost; OOF + first submission.\n  - D: Add angles/dihedrals (Karplus), neighbor/env features; retrain and blend.\n  - E: If still short, add two-stage (charges/shieldings, then contributions) with strict OOF stacking; final blends.\n\nExecute fast: per-type models + strict group CV + dihedral/Karplus for 3J + OOF-weighted blending should reach bronze; add two-stage stacking if you plateau."

First, I’ll load the minimal columns for the train and test datasets. I need to merge the folds_molecules for fold assignments in the training rows and do a double merge on atoms to gather coordinates and periodic properties for both atom0 and atom1. It’s crucial to compute distances, identities, sums, and differences of various properties. I also plan on combining molecule-level features and caching everything to parquet for efficiency. But, I must ensure that everything considers fold safety to avoid any potential leakage!**Building feature sets**\n\nI’m considering how to compute per-molecule statistics like z-scores, which I'll need to do in a fold-wise manner. For now, I’ll focus on using raw joins, which should be safe. I plan to implement a cell that builds features for both the train and test datasets, saving them to disk as X_train_v0.parquet and X_test_v0.parquet. There may be heavy memory usage with the 4.19 million rows, but I think it's manageable. I’ll check if XGBoost is installed, but if not, I can use LightGBM instead, which may be CPU-only. For a quick baseline, I might start with predicting the median per type to test the pipeline effectively.**Creating a baseline submission**\n\nI think it’s a good idea to create a baseline submission by predicting the per-type median from the training set and mapping it to the test types. It’s quick and allows me to ensure the submission format is correct. Before diving into heavy feature engineering, I'll insert a cell for calculating those medians and generating submission.csv. Although local logMAE via cross-validation isn’t possible on the test set, splitting can work. I’ll set up two cells: one for the baseline submission medians and the other to prepare features. Let's proceed with adding cell 4 to create that per-type median baseline.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 4,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Baseline submission: per-type median prediction\",\n      \"import pandas as pd, numpy as np, time, os\",\n      \"t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"train = pd.read_csv('train.csv', usecols=['type','scalar_coupling_constant'])\",\n      \"test = pd.read_csv('test.csv', usecols=['id','type'])\",\n      \"med = train.groupby('type')['scalar_coupling_constant'].median().to_dict()\",\n      \"print('Per-type medians:', med)\",\n      \"pred = test['type'].map(med).astype(np.float32)\",\n      \"sub = pd.DataFrame({'id': test['id'].values, 'scalar_coupling_constant': pred.values})\",\n      \"sub.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)\",\n      \"print('Saved submission.csv shape:', sub.shape, 'size(MB):', round(os.path.getsize('submission.csv')/1e6, 2))\",\n      \"print(sub.head())\",\n      \"print(f'Baseline submission ready in {time.time()-t0:.2f}s')\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\"\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Create a fast, safe baseline (per-type median) to validate submission pipeline and file format.

I want to be memory-conscious while merging and saving the parquet files, and I'll also incorporate additional features from dipole_moments.csv and potential_energy.csv.**Implementing feature extraction steps**\n\nI’m implementing a series of steps: first, I’ll load atoms.parquet, then load the train/test identifiers, including molecule names, atom indices, types, and targets. Next, I'll merge based on atom0 and atom1 with suffixes added. It’s essential to compute distances (dx, dy, dz) while avoiding divide by zero errors by adding a small value (1e-6). I'll also create flags and labels for elements, along with molecule-level features like potential energy and dipole components. Afterward, I’ll save the feature columns and prepare y_train.csv with relevant IDs. Finally, I'll merge folds for training without including mulliken/shielding data yet.**Preparing feature extraction steps**\n\nThe expert mentioned that while things are generally safe, I need to be careful. I should compute statistics fold-wise, but I can merge raw per-atom values later to keep things straightforward. I’ll create a new cell (index 5) for feature extraction and saving.

Any fold-scope transforms we should avoid at this stage?\\n5) Next features sequence after first baseline: implement bond graph (is_bonded, degree, shortest_path_len); then nearest-neighbor angle cos; then dihedral for 3J.

Start at 1.15 and sanity-check degrees (C avg ~3–4).\n- Ring flag can wait.\n\n2) Quick additions before first run\n- Structures-safe: log_dist = log(dist), EN_absdiff = abs(EN_diff), unordered element pair code (e.g., code = min(sym0,sym1)*8 + max(sym0,sym1)), molecule_atom_count (+ n_H, n_heavy), dipole projection onto bond (unit_dipole · unit_bond).\n- Also add now (safe for test; large gains): mulliken_charges (a0,a1,sum,diff) and magnetic_shielding isotropic ((XX+YY+ZZ)/3 for a0/a1, sum/diff).\n\n3) Modeling plan\n- Per-type XGBoost GPU with your CV is good and fits 45–60 min on A10.\n- Keep your defaults; slight tweaks if you wish:\n  - Add reg_alpha=0.1, reg_lambda=1\n  - 3J*: consider max_depth 9 and min_child_weight 8–12; 1J*: depth 6–8, mcw 14–18\n- tree_method=gpu_hist, objective=reg:squarederror, eval_metric=mae.\n- Track per-type MAE and overall LogMAE (mean log MAE_type).\n\n4) Leakage\n- potential_energy and dipoles: safe.\n- mulliken/shielding: direct per-atom merges are safe.\n- Avoid global molecule-level aggregates; if needed later, compute inside folds.\n\n5) Next features sequence\n- Correct order: graph (now) → nearest-neighbor angle cos → 3J dihedrals (Karplus terms). Add neighbor environment counts (bonded_C/H counts; min/max bonded distances) next; ring flag optional.\n\n6) Runtime tips\n- With cached features, go straight to full 5-fold. If you want a sanity check, do 1 fold on 1–2 types (800 trees) only, then proceed.\n\nMinimal scalable path-length pseudocode (thresholded covalent graph)\n- Build per-molecule adjacency once; compute degrees; answer only needed pair queries via BFS from unique sources.\n\ndef build_mol_graph(coords, covrads, k=1.15):\n    # coords: (n,3) float32; covrads: (n,) float32\n    n = len(coords)\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            dij = np.linalg.norm(coords[i] - coords[j])\n            thr = k * (covrads[i] + covrads[j])\n            if dij < thr:\n                adj[i].append(j); adj[j].append(i)\n    degrees = np.array([len(nei) for nei in adj], dtype=np.int8)\n    return adj, degrees\n\ndef bfs_from_sources(adj, sources, max_clip=6):\n    from collections import deque\n    n = len(adj)\n    dist_all = {}\n    for s in sources:\n        dist = [-1]*n\n        dq = deque([s]); dist[s] = 0\n        while dq:\n            u = dq.popleft()\n            if dist[u] >= max_clip:  # early stop\n                continue\n            for v in adj[u]:\n                if dist[v] == -1:\n                    dist[v] = dist[u] + 1\n                    dq.append(v)\n        dist_all[s] = dist\n    return dist_all\n\n# Driver per molecule:\n# atoms_mol: dataframe with atom_index, x,y,z,covrad; pairs_mol: dataframe with atom_index_0/1 rows for that molecule\n# Map global atom_index -> local 0..n-1, then:\nadj, deg = build_mol_graph(coords, covrads, k)\nsources = sorted(set(pairs_local[:,0]))\ndist_map = bfs_from_sources(adj, sources, max_clip=6)\npath_len = [dist_map[a0][a1] if dist_map[a0][a1] != -1 else 6 for a0,a1 in pairs_local]\nis_bonded = [int(d == 1) for d in path_len]\ndegree0 = [deg[a0] for a0,_ in pairs_local]\ndegree1 = [deg[a1] for _,a1 in pairs_local]\n\nAction checklist (do in this order)\n- Add mulliken_charges + shielding isotropic; add log_dist, EN_absdiff, pair_code, molecule_atom_count (+ n_H, n_heavy), dipole_projection.\n- Implement covalent graph; compute shortest_path_len (clip), is_bonded, degree_0/1. Cache v1.\n- Train full 5-fold per-type XGB GPU with light regularization; report per-type MAE and overall LogMAE.\n- Next: angles → dihedrals (3J) → neighbor env counts → optional ring flag.\n- Then consider CatBoost per-type and blend by per-type OOF.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: pivot to per-type models with chemistry-aware features, correct CV/metric, and a simple ensemble.\n\nWhat to do now (highest ROI)\n- Add missing quantum tables\n  - Join mulliken_charges (q0/q1; sum, diff, prod; neighbor charge stats within radii).\n  - Join magnetic_shielding_tensors; build isotropic ((xx+yy+zz)/3) and anisotropy per atom; sum/diff.\n- Build the bond graph\n  - Bonds via covalent radii threshold; degrees; neighbor counts by element; ring membership/size; shortest path length between atom0–atom1; bond types along path if derivable.\n- Geometry on the path\n  - 2J: angle at middle atom (A–B–C); use cos/sin(theta).\n  - 3J: dihedral A–B–C–D; Karplus terms: cos(phi), cos(2phi), cos(3phi); combine with distance terms (1/r, 1/r^2, 1/r^3).\n- Local environment\n  - Nearest neighbor distances by element (H/C/N/O/F); counts within shells; per-atom distance to molecule COM; simple Coulomb/inverse-distance summaries around atom0/1.\n\nModeling (per type)\n- Train 8 separate models (1JHC, 1JHN, 2JHC, 2JHH, 2JHN, 3JHC, 3JHH, 3JHN).\n- Start with LightGBM (regression_l1 or Huber). Harder types may need deeper trees; easier types can be shallower.\n- Also train CatBoost (GPU) per type with same features. Blend by per-type OOF weights.\n- Optional later: a SchNet/GNN model to ensemble for extra lift.\n\nCross-validation and metric\n- Use GroupKFold/StratifiedGroupKFold by molecule_name (you have this). Compute overall score as mean over types of log(MAE_type); monitor per-type OOF MAE and the log-mean.\n\nTraining details\n- 5 folds grouped; early stopping; large num_leaves/hist with regularization as needed.\n- No standardization for trees. Keep your current distance/dipole/energy features; add the new ones above.\n- Handle type as separate runs; keep minimal categorical encodings (sym0/sym1) if helpful.\n\nPost-processing\n- Per-type clipping to train percentiles (e.g., [p0.2, p99.8]).\n- Calibrate blend weights per type using OOF.\n\nAvoid\n- Leakage: any molecule-level aggregations, neighbor stats, or graph-derived summaries must be computed within folds.\n- Wrong metric aggregation (don’t log after global MAE).\n- Single global model mixing types.\n- Using scalar_coupling_contributions as features.\n\nQuick sequence (1–2 days)\n- Join Mulliken + shielding; engineer iso/anisotropy and charge features (+ simple neighbor charge stats).\n- Build bonds, shortest path, ring flags; implement 2J angle and 3J dihedral + Karplus terms.\n- Train per-type LightGBM with current + new features; record per-type OOF and log-mean.\n- Train per-type CatBoost; OOF-weighted blend; apply per-type clipping; submit.\n\nExpected progress\n- Adding Mulliken/shielding + path length moves you off median.\n- Angles/dihedrals (Karplus) and neighbor context typically push into bronze/silver when blended."

    "llm_json": "**Evaluating implementation risks**\n\nI’m considering potential time risks in implementing the FE v1 cell. The dataset is large at 4.19M, and with about 76k molecules, that means loops per molecule could take some time. It seems reasonable since the average pairs per molecule is approximately 55. When building the graph, I'm calculating a lot of distance checks — around 24.6 million — which could be slow, especially in Python. However, since the averages are manageable, I think it's feasible to proceed and add logs every 5,000 molecules.**Preparing for code execution**\n\nI’m adding a few components to my implementation: logging the distance and calculating absolute differences. I’ll precompute a DataFrame for molecule counts and include total atoms, hydrogen counts, and heavy atoms. When dealing with dipole projections, I'll use the unit bond formula and the molecule dipole vector. I’ll also reuse the mol_ctx for reading and normalization. Next, I’ll write the cell code and edit the file to insert cell 6 before executing it. Finally, I’ll save outputs in the specified formats while being mindful of memory usage.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 6,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# FE v1: add mulliken + shielding iso + quick extras + covalent graph features;

    "llm_json": "**Fixing column duplication error**\n\nI need to address an error in cell 6 regarding the column label 'molecule_name' not being unique. It seems that when sorting Xte_base in add_graph_features, there are duplicate columns named 'molecule_name'. In build_pair_frame, the list should include 'id', 'type', 'molecule_name', and 'fold' if is_train is true; otherwise, it should just be 'molecule_name'. The way it's currently structured results in 'molecule_name' appearing twice, especially when is_train is false, which is causing the error.**Revising the keep list**\n\nI’m planning to fix the list construction for 'keep' in a cleaner way. I’ll set it up as: keep = ['id','type','molecule_name'] + (['fold'] if is_train else []) + [rest...]. This means I need to modify cell 6 to make this change. Additionally, I'll ensure we de-duplicate columns using .loc[:,columns.duplicated()]. \n\nAfter making these adjustments, I shouldn’t need to rerun cell 6 completely since that could take a long time; instead, I should see if I can reuse the cached Xtr_v1. The previous function didn’t save correctly, so I’ll make adjustments there as well.**Addressing variable state and caching**\n\nThe Xtr_v1 variable only exists during that execution. Now that the kernel is idle, the previous variables are typically gone when we re-execute cells. I want to avoid retraining since running the same cell again would overwrite previous variables and rerun the train graph. One idea is to add an early exit path by checking if X_train_v1.parquet already exists, but it doesn’t. Instead, I might opt to cache the intermediate graph in a temporary file or address the duplicate column error while implementing an early return, since the graph features for train are already computed.**Optimizing graph feature addition**\n\nTo address the error, I'll tweak the add_graph_features function to deduplicate columns first. Then, I can re-execute only the test graph part without recomputing the training graph. However, I can’t easily execute just a subset, so I’ll add a guard: if 'Xtr_v1' is already defined in locals(), I’ll skip adding the graph for train. \n\nIn the notebook, I'll implement a check to either add features for train or use the existing Xtr_v1. Additionally, I’ll ensure unique columns in Xbase before sorting. Finally, I’ll wrap the calls with guards to dictate whether to compute or skip.**Preparing to run the test graph**\n\nNext, I need to execute cell 6 to proceed with running the test graph. It will process fewer pairs, totaling around 467,000 pairs across 76,510 molecules, which is similar to the molecule count. The test has a subset of different molecules, and while it includes about 250,000 pairs, the molecule count remains the same at 76,510. Since the number of molecules is unchanged but there are fewer pairs per molecule for the test, the time taken should be comparable to the training graph, though possibly slightly less.

Currently, I see that cell 6 is executing, so I think I should wait, maybe like 15 minutes, until the test graph finishes since the train graph is already done. The output indicates the computation will restart due to the guard condition. It didn’t reset the kernel, but it still seems like I’ve lost my previous variables due to the error, which is frustrating since they would normally persist in the notebook.**Reassessing variable state**\n\nI executed cell 6 earlier, but it errored before saving, so Xtr_v1 was in memory at that point. Since I modified the cell and re-executed, I thought Xtr_v1 would still be in globals. I also just did a kernel sleep without restarting, so theoretically, it should still exist. However, the current run only shows initial messages — I’ll need to see if it reaches the part about Xtr_v1. It might be safer to change things to skip recomputing if the cache exists, but that requires checking for the X_train_v1.parquet file. Unfortunately, I have to recompute the train graph, which could take another 80 minutes.**Evaluating the guard condition**\n\nI see that the guard is using 'if Xtr_v1 not in globals()'. Given that there are kernel variables present, it should allow me to skip recomputing. The error stack implies Xtr_v1 existed, so I'm going to assume it still does. If that’s the case, only the test graph will run, which might still take around 80 minutes. I can let it run and set a sleep for about 60 minutes to check afterwards. Since there's a 22-hour budget left, it should be fine.

    "llm_json": "**Fixing KeyError Issue**\n\nI need to address a KeyError related to 'fold' not being in the index when building the pair frame during training. It seems we accidentally removed merging with folds previously. I should ensure that when `is_train` is true, we re-add the merge statement for `folds` based on `molecule_name`. Additionally, I’ll check that `folds_molecules.csv` has the required 'fold' column. I also want to add caching to avoid recomputing the train graph if a specific file already exists.**Improving the Kernel Process**\n\nThe kernel is showing idle because the last cell run errored before creating `Xtr_v1`, so it will compute the train graph again, which is quite large. To improve the process, I want to check if the file `X_train_v1.parquet` exists, but it hasn’t been created yet. I can save the train graph results immediately after creating `Xtr_v1`, which helps avoid loss if there’s an error later. I’ll also add a try/except around the test addition to save the train cache first. Additionally, I must reinsert the fold merge before running cell 6 again.**Adjusting for Graph Computation**\n\nThe larger train graph already completed in a previous run, which faced a KeyError when starting the test. The current kernel shows \"idle,\" and re-executing the cell indicates it's still processing. However, since there’s no `X_train_v1.parquet`, it seems it errored earlier. To remedy this, I could check for a cached training graph and load it, but since it doesn't exist, I might consider using the saved v0 features for modeling now and handle v1 computation later. That would be a more efficient approach.**Optimizing Graph Rebuilding**\n\nExperts suggested doing the graph and applying Mulliken/shielding before the first run to gain an advantage. However, if rebuilding the graph takes too long, I might have to compromise, even though we've already paid the cost. We could build the graph just for testing, but it's also necessary for the training out-of-fold. It seems we need to recompute `Xtr_v1`, as it's not saved. The previous run computed the train graph but stopped before the test. I could optimize the process by using KDTree or consider using Numba to speed up the loops, although implementing changes would take some time.**Modifying Cell for Improvements**\n\nAlright, I need to fix and re-run cell 6. Accepting that redrawing graph features takes about 80 minutes, we can parallel plan the modeling code in another file while we wait. Since tools limit one use per turn, I could request an expert review during that time. First, I’ll edit cell 6 to reintroduce the merge of folds and ensure we save `Xtr_v1` before the test. I’ll also implement a check to skip recomputing the train graph if `Xtr_v1_path` exists. Finally, I need to adjust the logic at the bottom for checking file existence before loading or computing.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 6,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# FE v1: add mulliken + shielding iso + quick extras + covalent graph features; cache v1\",\n      \"import pandas as pd, numpy as np, time, os, gc\",\n      \"from collections import deque, defaultdict\",\n      \"\",\n      \"t0 = time.time()\",\n      \"print('Loading base inputs...')\",\n      \"atoms = pd.read_parquet('atoms.parquet')  # has periodic props, coords\",\n      \"folds = pd.read_csv('folds_molecules.csv')\",\n      \"train = pd.read_csv('train.csv', usecols=['id','molecule_name','atom_index_0','atom_index_1','type','scalar_coupling_constant'])\",\n      \"test  = pd.read_csv('test.csv',  usecols=['id','molecule_name','atom_index_0','atom_index_1','type'])\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Molecule-level safe tables\",\n      \"pot = pd.read_csv('potential_energy.csv')\",\n      \"dip = pd.read_csv('dipole_moments.csv')\",\n      \"dip_cols = set(dip.columns.str.lower())\",\n      \"if {'dx','dy','dz'}.issubset(dip_cols):\",\n      \"    dip = dip.rename(columns={c: c.lower() for c in dip.columns if c.lower() in {'dx','dy','dz'}})\",\n      \"elif {'x','y','z'}.issubset(dip_cols):\",\n      \"    r = {};\",\n      \"    [r.setdefault(c, {'x':'dx','y':'dy','z':'dz'}[c.lower()]) for c in dip.columns if c.lower() in {'x','y','z'}]\",\n      \"    dip = dip.rename(columns=r)\",\n      \"dip['dip_norm'] = np.sqrt(dip['dx']**2 + dip['dy']**2 + dip['dz']**2).astype(np.float32)\",\n      \"mol_ctx = pot.merge(dip, on='molecule_name', how='left')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Quantum per-atom tables (safe for test)\",\n      \"print('Loading mulliken and shielding...')\",\n      \"mull = pd.read_csv('mulliken_charges.csv')        # molecule_name, atom_index, mulliken_charge\",\n      \"shield = pd.read_csv('magnetic_shielding_tensors.csv')  # molecule_name, atom_index, diag terms\",\n      \"# Normalize shield column names to robustly find diagonal terms\",\n      \"shield.columns = [str(c).lower() for c in shield.columns]\",\n      \"def find_col(sdf, suffix):\",\n      \"    for c in sdf.columns:\",\n      \"        cl = str(c).lower()\",\n      \"        if cl == suffix or cl.endswith('_'+suffix):\",\n      \"            return c\",\n      \"    return None\",\n      \"c_xx = find_col(shield, 'xx')\",\n      \"c_yy = find_col(shield, 'yy')\",\n      \"c_zz = find_col(shield, 'zz')\",\n      \"if c_xx is None or c_yy is None or c_zz is None:\",\n      \"    raise KeyError(f'Diagonal shielding columns not found.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the shortest path to a safe, medal‑ready v1 run, synthesizing all four audits.\n\n1) Graph params and low‑cost adds\n- Keep k=1.15 and clip_len=6. These are standard and medal‑tier.\n- Minimal, cheap wins to add now (do not balloon runtime):\n  - degree features: deg_sum = degree_0 + degree_1; deg_diff = degree_0 − degree_1\n  - size/scale: dist_over_covsum = dist / (covrad0 + covrad1 + 1e-6)\n  - covalent radii stats: covrad_min, covrad_max\n  - dipole extras: dip_cos = dip_proj / (dip_norm + 1e-6), and dip_abs_proj = |dip_proj|\n  - common_neighbors: |N(a0) ∩ N(a1)| from the adjacency lists you already build; compute per pair after BFS (cheap)\n- Defer angles/dihedrals and shortest‑paths count to v2. Optional now (still cheap): nearest‑neighbor angle cos at A0/A1 using nearest non‑partner by Euclidean distance.\n\n2) Merge/dtype pitfalls to avoid (and fix the “fold not in index”)\n- Root cause of the preserved KeyError: keep included 'fold' but it wasn’t merged (or got dropped). Fix and guard:\n  - Immediately after merging folds for train: assert out['fold'].notna().all(), \"Missing fold on train\"\n  - Ensure you merge folds before dropping duplicate columns, then select keep.\n  - Keep this order: merge folds -> remove duplicated columns -> select keep.\n- Add hard checks right after building Xtr_base/Xte_base and v1:\n  - assert Xtr_base['id'].is_unique and Xte_base['id'].is_unique\n  - For train only: assert 'fold' in Xtr_base.columns and Xtr_base['fold'].isna().sum()==0\n  - No column inflation: ensure only one molecule_name column after merges\n- Dtypes: keep flags int8, path_len and degrees int16 (or int8 for path_len if you prefer), ids int32, floats float32. Continue replacing inf with 0 in ratios. Add np.isfinite checks post-build.\n\n3) Runtime/speed\n- Your ~80–90 min one‑time BFS is acceptable with caching. Launch as is.\n- You already pre‑sort by molecule_name. If you want a safe micro‑speedup later: numba on adjacency+BFS; cKDTree is optional and not necessary for these molecule sizes.\n\n4) Shielding and dipole handling\n- Isotropic shielding = (XX+YY+ZZ)/3 is correct (your robust column finder is good).\n- Dipole projection onto the bond unit vector is correct. Add dip_cos and |dip_proj| with 1e-6 guard on dip_norm.\n\n5) Validation/leakage\n- Pipeline is leak‑free: folds merged only to train; all features from test‑available sources; per‑molecule graphs from structures only. Keep it that way for any future global aggregates (compute inside folds if you add them later).\n\nImplementation nits (quick edits)\n- After graph build, add:\n  - X['deg_sum'] = degree_0 + degree_1; X['deg_diff'] = degree_0 - degree_1\n  - X['dist_over_covsum'] = dist / (covrad0 + covrad1 + 1e-6)\n  - X['covrad_min'] = min(covrad0, covrad1); X['covrad_max'] = max(covrad0, covrad1)\n  - X['dip_cos'] = dip_proj / (dip_norm + 1e-6); X['dip_abs_proj'] = abs(dip_proj)\n  - X['common_neighbors'] from adj lists per molecule\n- Add post‑run sanity checks:\n  - Exact shapes: X_train_v1 rows == train rows; X_test_v1 rows == test rows\n  - No NaN/inf in key columns; value counts for path_len; mean is_bonded close to 0 for 3J types\n\nGreen light: run Cell 6 now with the tiny adds above. Start per‑type XGBoost GPU training as soon as train v1 parquet is saved.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: You’re close on plan but far on execution. Move from FE to modeling now, add coupling-aware geometry next, and ensemble. Use strict group CV, avoid leaks, and iterate fast.\n\nDiagnosis (what’s missing)\n- No trained models; pace too slow.\n- v1 features alone won’t medal; you need angles/dihedrals and path-aware features.\n- Ensure per-type modeling and robust group CV.\n\nImmediate actions (today–next 48h)\n- Compute v1 features now and cache: X_train_v1.parquet / X_test_v1.parquet. If the “fold not in index” error reappears, merge folds before column selection and assert 'fold' exists: out = out.merge(folds[['molecule_name','fold']], on='molecule_name', how='left'); assert 'fold' in out.\n- Start per-type GBM training today:\n  - CV: 5-fold StratifiedGroupKFold by molecule_name (already built).\n  - Models: LightGBM or XGBoost GPU; objective MAE; early stopping.\n  - Track per-type OOF logMAE; identify weak types (often 1JHC/3JHN).\n\nFeature roadmap (v2, add on top of v1)\n- Path/graph features:\n  - shortest_path_len (have), is_bonded (have), degrees (have).\n  - For 2J/3J: capture intermediate path atoms; sum/mean/min/max bond lengths along path.\n  - Ring flags and ring size (cycle basis).\n- Angles/dihedrals (critical):\n  - 2J: angle atom0–mid–atom1; add cos(angle).\n  - 3J: dihedral over 4-atom path; Karplus terms: cos(phi), cos^2(phi).\n  - 1J: precise bond length, local bonded environment stats.\n- Local environment:\n  - Neighbor counts by element within 1–2 bond hops; k-NN distances (k=1..3).\n  - Neighbor summaries: sums/means of EN, Mulliken charge, shielding.\n- Pair-typed refinements:\n  - pair_code × path_len interactions.\n  - Bond order proxy: dist/(covrad0+covrad1).\n  - Dipole–bond angle and |cos| (you have dip_proj; add absolute angle).\n\nModeling and ensembling\n- Train 8 separate models (one per coupling type).\n- Start params (tune later):\n  - XGBoost: tree_method=gpu_hist, objective=reg:absoluteerror, max_depth 6–9, lr 0.03–0.07, 3–10k trees, early_stopping_rounds ~50.\n  - LightGBM GPU: l1 objective, num_leaves 63–255, min_data_in_leaf 100–500, lr 0.02–0.05, 5–15k iters.\n- Blend per type: LightGBM + CatBoost/XGBoost weighted by OOF performance. Optionally add simple Karplus regressor for 3J and KRR/RBF for 1J as weak learners.\n- Symmetry: average predictions for (atom0,atom1) and swapped features.\n- Residual smoothing (OOF-only): per type, bin by key driver (1J: distance; 2J: angle; 3J: dihedral) and apply a smoothed correction to test.\n\nQuality, pitfalls, and checks\n- Zero leakage: never use scalar_coupling_contributions; compute any train-derived stats within folds only; keep group CV by molecule_name.\n- Balance types: the metric averages log-MAE across types; don’t neglect rare types (1JHN).\n- Validate OOF vs LB; investigate any mismatch (CV split issues, leaks).\n- Feature hygiene: stable dipole/shielding column names; downcast dtypes; ensure test-time computability.\n\nEfficiency and execution\n- Cache everything (parquet); precompute per-molecule graph, neighbor lists, ring cycles once; parallelize per-molecule FE; write shards then concat.\n- Use GPU for trees; iterate quickly: baseline v1 → train → add angles/dihedrals → retrain → ensemble → residual smoothing.\n- Milestones: 1) v1 + first OOF today. 2) v2 angles/dihedrals within next iteration. 3) Blend + smoothing to push to ≤ -1.90.\n\nEmergency acceleration\n- If v1 FE stalls: train on v0 now; compute angles/dihedrals in parallel; use shallower trees for fast feedback; swap in richer features as they land.\n\nConcise, actionable summary\n- Run v1 FE now; fix fold merge if needed. Start per-type GPU GBMs today; get OOF by type.\n- Implement v2: angles (2J), dihedrals + Karplus (3J), path/ring and neighbor environment features.\n- Retrain, then ensemble CatBoost/XGBoost/LightGBM per type; add symmetry averaging and OOF-based residual smoothing.\n- Maintain strict group CV, avoid leaks, and iterate rapidly. This path gets you to bronze (≤ -1.90)."

    "llm_json": "**Planning modeling code**\n\nI'm considering our cell computing features and the next best step. Should I sleep again or request an expert review? The guidelines indicate I should request a review during training, but I can only use one tool at a time. It seems reasonable to plan the modeling code in a new cell while the current cell executes. We can add a new modeling cell that will be ready to run once the features are saved, and check for training to start when the necessary file exists.**Setting up modeling plan**\n\nIn the next step, I can either request an expert review on the hyperparameters or wait to execute once the appropriate file is ready. I should add code to cell 7 to load `X_train_v1` if it exists, or fall back on `X_train_v0`. Experts advise against training on `v0`, yet it could be an emergency option. I'll implement per-type training with five folds, using a specified mapping. I’ll track and save predictions, ensuring we have minimal dependencies and log our progress consistently. For now, I’ll insert the modeling code and not run it just yet.**Developing training function**\n\nI want to print the folds and elapsed times, so I'll add a training function in cell 7. First, I’ll load `X_train_v1.parquet` and `y_train.csv` and decide on the feature columns, dropping identifiers like `id`, `molecule_name`, `type`, `fold`, and considering the `atom_index_0/1`. They might help, but including them could cause leakage. It’s safer to drop `atom_index_0/1`, keeping in mind that grouping via cross-validation will keep molecules separate. The StratifiedGroupKFold mapping is already in `Xtr` through 'fold.'**Setting up training loop**\n\nI’ll implement a loop that uses fold assignments instead of re-splitting. For each type, I’ll subset the rows and perform KFold splits via the fold column. I’ll use the `XGBRegressor` with parameters like a large number of `n_estimators` (up to 10,000 rounds), a learning rate of 0.05, and other settings including max depth and subsampling. While saving the models isn't essential, we can choose to do it. Once out-of-fold (OOF) predictions are complete, I’ll compute the log MAE by type and combine it. Finally, I’ll prepare to train on the full type data and predict when `X_test_v1` is available.

I want to begin modeling right after that, but I can’t run Cell 7 while Cell 6 is active in the same notebook kernel. \n\nMy strategy is to sleep until the training is likely saved. Progress is at 42k/76.5k molecules, estimating around another 35 minutes, so I think 35 minutes of sleep is efficient. Alternatively, I could open a new Python script to train while waiting.**Optimizing training process**\n\nI can't run code in the same notebook at the same time, but I could create a train_xgb_v1.py script to detect the file and run the training separately. This would allow better parallelization since best practices suggest running training in a subprocess. Although creating a new file adds extra steps, I think I can manage it in two turns. \n\nFor now, I can sleep for 30-40 minutes, then run Cell 7 once Cell 6 finishes. Starting a separate script is definitely a better approach to maximize efficiency.**Creating a new script**\n\nI need to create a new script, train_xgb_v1.py, with code that polls for the existence of X_train_v1.parquet and starts the training by saving out-of-fold predictions and possibly models. Executing the code on this script will allow it to start training as soon as the file exists. \n\nTo do this, I'll implement create_file to make a blank train_xgb_v1.py file first, then I can edit it. Since I can only use one tool per turn, I’ll spend two turns creating and populating the script and maybe a third to execute it.**Creating the script**\n\nIn this turn, I need to create the file 'train_xgb_v1.py'. This file will serve as the foundation for my training script, which will wait for the X_train_v1.parquet file to exist before starting the training process. I’ll make sure to keep the file empty for now and then move on to populating it with the appropriate code in the next turn.

    "llm_json": "**Planning xgboost integration**\n\nI need to choose a tool for my task. The goal is to create a script for train_xgb_v1.py that waits for X_train_v1.parquet, trains an XGB model per type, similar to Cell 7, and predicts when X_test_v1 is available. I must check if xgboost is installed since it may or may not be pre-installed in the Kaggle container. Also, I'll add a script to check for and install xgboost if it's missing, ensuring to poll for file existence with logging.**Implementing prediction logic**\n\nOnce X_test_v1 exists, I'll generate predictions and create a submission; otherwise, I'll wait for it to predict later. It's essential to have folds present in train features, so let’s proceed with the implementation. I can use either xgboost's XGBRegressor or the DMatrix API, both work fine. I’ll reuse code from Cell 7 while keeping everything self-contained. I also need to check for GPU availability, which means optionally logging with nvidia-smi. I'll import necessary libraries and define helper functions to load data and handle folds properly.**Setting up predictions**\n\nFor our later predictions, the models need to infer on the test data. I can either train models on the full dataset per type after out-of-fold (OOF) predictions or train models per fold and average predictions on the test data. The preferred approach is to wait for the test features to train full models per type using the best iteration average. Once those features are available, I’ll retrain each model using the median of the best iterations, then predict and average results. Also, I’ll compute n_rounds_per_type as the median and save it to a file.**Finalizing prediction workflow**\n\nNext, I’ll wait for X_test_v1.parquet, load it, and build consistent feature columns for predictions. The plan is to use xgb.train on the full dataset per type with the specified n_rounds, then predict the test data. I’ll collect the predictions, generate a submission file, and ensure it merges the ID and predictions in the correct order. \n\nTo implement this, I should ensure that xgboost is imported. If the import fails, I’ll set up a try/except to install xgboost and check for GPU support. Lastly, I’ll edit train_xgb_v1.py to include all the necessary content.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"train_xgb_v1.py\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"source\": [\n      \"#!/usr/bin/env python3\",\n      \"import os, time, sys, json, gc\",\n      \"import numpy as np\",\n      \"import pandas as pd\",\n      \"from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def log(msg):\",\n      \"    print(f\\\"[{time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] {msg}\\\", flush=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def wait_for(path, check_interval=30):\",\n      \"    while not os.path.exists(path):\",\n      \"        log(f'Waiting for {path} ...')\",\n      \"        time.sleep(check_interval)\",\n      \"    log(f'Found {path}')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def log_mae_by_type(y_true, y_pred, types):\",\n      \"    vals = []\",\n      \"    for t in np.unique(types):\",\n      \"        m = (types == t)\",\n      \"        mae = float(np.mean(np.abs(y_true[m] - y_pred[m])))\",\n      \"        vals.append(np.log(mae + 1e-9))\",\n      \"    return float(np.mean(vals))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"def main():\",\n      \"    feat_train_path = 'X_train_v1.parquet'\",\n      \"    y_path = 'y_train.csv'\",\n      \"    feat_test_path = 'X_test_v1.parquet'\",\n      \"\",\n      \"    wait_for(feat_train_path, check_interval=60)\",\n      \"    if not os.path.exists(y_path):\",\n      \"        raise FileNotFoundError(f'Missing {y_path}')\",\n      \"\",\n      \"    try:\",\n      \"        import xgboost as xgb\",\n      \"    except Exception as e:\",\n      \"        log('xgboost import failed.

I think we used `pd.read_csv` for both potential energy and dipole moments files. I should check if any test molecules lack entries in `dipole_moments.csv`. Since I can’t run the code now, I think it’s safer to fill NaN values in `dx`, `dy`, `dz`, and `dip_norm` with 0 after constructing `mol_ctx`. I'm also thinking it’s wise to adjust assertions to fill non-finite values before saving.**Recomputing features and training**\n\nI want to recompute the features since we've already finished that part.

The parquet files are present, though, and the training script is waiting for `X_test_v1`, which is now ready. I can monitor the training or generate a submission. XGBoost can handle NaNs by default, but I think it’s still good practice to fix those issues for future runs. It keeps everything tidy!**Monitoring training logs**\n\nI’m thinking about opening `docker_run.log` to check the training script logs, but maybe that’s not strictly necessary.

The parquet files seem to exist; however, they might contain NaNs. I need to check if training proceeded and if submission was produced, as I’m seeing submission_xgb_v1.csv. Let's investigate further!**Planning script execution**\n\nI think we might need to execute the training script again, but it's already running and waiting. Both parquet files exist, so it should proceed. There was an assertion failure in the notebook, but that shouldn't stop the script. I need to check if oof_xgb_v1.csv exists. Using File Explorer, I see that y_train.csv is timestamped old, while X_train_v1 was saved more recently. However, I'm not seeing new files like oof_xgb_v1.csv or submission_xgb_v1.csv in Explorer, so I'll need to monitor the training progress. There are non-finite values in the features, but I know XGBoost handles NaN by default. What should I do next?**Considering training strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about taking a short break while the training progresses, maybe for 30 minutes, but I want to check periodically for file existence since the training is heavy. With multiple types and folds, and a large number of trees, this could take a while. I wonder if I should interrupt the current script and run a faster cross-validation with fewer rounds. It feels risky, but I might execute a modeling cell and adjust the rounds instead. Let's open oof_xgb_v1.csv to see if it contains any data. I'll try that now!**Deciding on file checks**\n\nI'm considering whether to open oof_xgb_v1.csv directly since if it doesn't exist, the tool will error. I can't access File Explorer, so I’ll try open_file instead, but if that fails, we won’t get any feedback. An alternative could be executing a small Python snippet to list files and sizes, but that won't work since I can only run notebooks or scripts. I could create a new cell to check for files or maybe ask for expert review. But it feels like that might not be necessary. Let's try opening the file first!**Addressing assertion issues**\n\nI need to fix the assertion in Cell 6 to prevent future failures. I can modify the cell to fill NaNs for dip fields with 0s and set ratios to safe values, changing the post-run check to replace non-finite values with 0 rather than asserting. However, since training is already ongoing, it wouldn’t be great to rerun heavy feature engineering.

It’s possible that XGB isn't installed, or we missed checking the logs. I should review whether training artifacts like oof_xgb_v1.csv and models_info_xgb_v1.json exist, as they weren't visible in the file explorer.**Reviewing Docker logs and model adjustments**\n\nI should check the docker_run.log, but it’s a huge file.

Instead, I could execute the training in notebook cell 7 since the features exist, but there might be a conflict if xgboost isn't installed. Installing it seems unnecessary, as the environment likely already has it. Given the performance alert, I should close open files to improve performance and adjust the model to handle NaNs, which XGBoost can process. There may be NaNs in the dip fields due to missing dipole moments for some molecules.**Preparing for training execution**\n\nIt looks like the non-finite values might come from NaNs in the dx/dy/dz variables due to missing molecules in dipole or potential data for tests.

XGBoost 2.0 allows setting device='cpu', and I should handle NaNs too. I'll change xgb_params to include 'tree_method': 'hist' and 'device': 'cpu', also reducing num_boost_round to 10,000. Training on CPU may be slow with large data, but I have 36 vCPUs, so I'll use multi-threading. Should I consider sampling, or opt for CatBoost with GPU? There’s some uncertainty about installation.**Considering GPU options**\n\nXGBoost not having CUDA is a blocker, so I could install a GPU-enabled version via pip with CUDA 12.1, but it might remain CPU-only. Reinstalling xgboost could take time. CatBoost, on the other hand, supports CUDA, and I can install it easily if CUDA is present. That may be a better route. While my script is set for XGBoost, maybe I should create a new train_catboost_v1.py. It does mean multiple steps, but I can manage it despite the current performance issues. Adjusting the training script to CPU feels risky and likely too slow.**Creating CatBoost script**\n\nI think it's better to write a script for CatBoost, so I’ll create train_cat_v1.py with polling for features. I’ll set it up per type, using Pool and 5 folds based on the 'fold' column. The parameters will include loss_function='MAE', depth 8, learning_rate 0.05, l2_leaf_reg, iterations 20,000, and task_type='GPU'. CatBoost can handle NaNs. I’ll create the file first, then populate it in the next turn since I can only do one operation at a time. It seems the best way to proceed!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"create_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"train_catboost_v1.py\",\n  \"explanation\": \"XGBoost in this environment lacks CUDA support, causing GPU errors.

Best practices recommend getting an expert review after creating a plan, so I should do that at major\n💭 workflow checkpoints. I think the next step is to request expert advice on our plan and medal strategies. Plus, checking the environment is essential. Starting with `nvidia-smi` is suggested, so I’ll\n💭 execute that after creating the code cell.\n💭 **Requesting expert input** I think it’s a good idea to request expert guidance on known good features for CHAMPS, such as distance, angles, bond types, atom environments, and graph path lengths. For\n💭 our models, I want to ensure validation involves grouping by molecule name, possibly stratified by type using additional data files. I'm cautious about target leaks, especially using test contributions\n💭 . I can train models per type, leveraging features like structures, tensors, and potential energy. Let’s ask for more expert insight on this!\n💭 **Requesting expert review** I'm planning to use the `request_expert_review` function with the filepath `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb`. I want to include specific questions about confirming cross-validation\n💭 , feature sets, and modeling choices like XGB or CatBoost for each type. I also need guidance on how to handle large structure files (*.xyz) since I have a `structures.csv` that includes positions. So\n💭 , yes, let's go ahead and request that expert review!\nINFO: Agent JSON response received: {\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint A: Plan + strategy validation before coding.

I should run this script because it will help install CatBoost if necessary and utilize the GPU. It seems there might be an older\n💭 process running with train_xgb_v1.py waiting, but it could be CPU-heavy. Let's launch the training!\n💭 **Proceeding with CatBoost training** There was an earlier waiting state for the features, which might have caused an error due to GPU issues in the notebook. It’s possible that the previous process is\n💭 still running, or it has stopped due to that error. However, I think we can move forward with the catboost script without concern.

I'll modify the train_catboost_v1.py file by removing 'rsm':\n💭 0.8 from params and setting 'devices': '0'. To ensure the GPU works, I need to check how CatBoost handles non-finite issues in test features. Since CatBoost can manage NaN but not infinities, I should\n💭 replace inf with NaN before training, especially since there might be non-finite values in dip_cos or dist_over_covsum.\n💭 **Preprocessing X data** I’m thinking we can preprocess X by replacing positive and negative infinity values with np.nan in the training script — that feels like a good move! I'll add a line right after\n💭 loading X: X.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan, inplace=True). I'll also need to do something similar for the test data.

However, I should also consider closing unnecessary files for performance health since we're at a critical 25%. It makes sense to let CatBoost run without interruption for a bit.**Waiting for training logs**\n\nIt looks like the `docker_run.log` file has updates from earlier orchestrator logs instead of the current training logs. The training script probably prints with log prefixes, but we can’t see stdout right now. I can’t query the file explorer either, and the context shows `oof_cat_v1.csv` is missing, with `submission.csv` coming from the baseline. I think waiting might be best here.

The log file indicates it was last modified a short time ago, but I haven’t seen the new artifact files yet. We're dealing with a performance health alert since there are a few open files and a significant character count in the logs. I should prioritize closing unnecessary files to prevent crashes. It might be best to take a short break and then check for artifact files. However, I can't list the directory, so let's see if `oof_cat_v1.csv` exists.**Managing file performance**\n\nI need to find the right balance between sleeping and maintaining performance. The maximum sleep time is 60 minutes per tool, so I'll opt for a shorter sleep of 20-30 minutes. It’s also important to close large files to improve performance. Currently, I have four open files, and there are 300,000 visible characters in `docker_run.log`. I think closing that log file first is the best move, and I can manage the others afterward. Let’s go ahead and close `docker_run.log` this turn.**Reducing memory usage**\n\nI need to focus on reducing memory usage while ensuring that training continues effectively. The next step is to implement a short sleep of 20 minutes and then check for any generated artifacts. This approach should help maintain performance and stability during the training process. It’s essential to stay on top of both memory management and artifact monitoring for a smooth workflow.

The log file indicates it was last modified a short time ago, but I haven\n💭 ’t seen the new artifact files yet. We're dealing with a performance health alert since there are a few open files and a significant character count in the logs. I should prioritize closing unnecessary\n💭 files to prevent crashes. It might be best to take a short break and then check for artifact files. However, I can't list the directory, so let's see if `oof_cat_v1.csv` exists.\n💭 **Managing file performance** I need to find the right balance between sleeping and maintaining performance. The maximum sleep time is 60 minutes per tool, so I'll opt for a shorter sleep of 20-30 minutes\n💭 . It’s also important to close large files to improve performance. Currently, I have four open files, and there are 300,000 visible characters in `docker_run.log`. I think closing that log file first is\n💭 the best move, and I can manage the others afterward. Let’s go ahead and close `docker_run.log` this turn.\n💭 **Reducing memory usage** I need to focus on reducing memory usage while ensuring that training continues effectively. The next step is to implement a short sleep of 20 minutes and then check for any\n💭 generated artifacts. This approach should help maintain performance and stability during the training process. It’s essential to stay on top of both memory management and artifact monitoring for a smooth\n💭 workflow.

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Decision: Stop the current run now.

Cache graphs/paths; sanitize math.\n2) Rebuild X_train_v2/X_test_v2 with consistent columns; regenerate OOF per type.\n3) Train per-type CatBoost v2; if OOF > -1.9, add 2–4 CatBoost seeds + 1 LightGBM and average.\n4) If still short, run a small per-type GNN and blend.\n5) Clip extreme predictions to plausible ranges if needed; submit only after OOF ≤ -1.9.\n\nMilestones\n- After adding angles/torsions: expect large OOF drop on 2J/3J; overall OOF < -1.3.\n- With neighbor/graph enrichments + small ensemble: push to ≤ -1.9 OOF."

Best practices recommend getting an expert review after creating a plan, so I should do that at major\n💭 workflow checkpoints. I think the next step is to request expert advice on our plan and medal strategies. Plus, checking the environment is essential. Starting with `nvidia-smi` is suggested, so I’ll\n💭 execute that after creating the code cell.\n💭 **Requesting expert input** I think it’s a good idea to request expert guidance on known good features for CHAMPS, such as distance, angles, bond types, atom environments, and graph path lengths. For\n💭 our models, I want to ensure validation involves grouping by molecule name, possibly stratified by type using additional data files. I'm cautious about target leaks, especially using test contributions\n💭 . I can train models per type, leveraging features like structures, tensors, and potential energy. Let’s ask for more expert insight on this!\n💭 **Requesting expert review** I'm planning to use the `request_expert_review` function with the filepath `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb`. I want to include specific questions about confirming cross-validation\n💭 , feature sets, and modeling choices like XGB or CatBoost for each type. I also need guidance on how to handle large structure files (*.xyz) since I have a `structures.csv` that includes positions. So\n💭 , yes, let's go ahead and request that expert review!\nINFO: Agent JSON response received: {\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint A: Plan + strategy validation before coding.

The current script is train_catboost_v1.py, but it hasn't generated any artifacts yet—only updates in the docker log and an NVML error with nvidia-smi. It seems the script is running fine, and I should check back later. However, performance health is low, suggesting I should close some open files, like train_xgb_v1.py and docker_run.log, to enhance performance. Following instructions, I'll monitor periodically instead of forcing actions.**Deciding on next steps**\n\nI think the next best action is to run monitoring cell 8 again or check for files in the file system. I could also open the out-of-fold file, but it might not exist. Running monitoring cell 8 will take minimal time, or I could sleep for 10 minutes to let the training proceed. Since we have a performance alert, closing unnecessary files like train_xgb_v1.py or docker_run.log could help, but I can only close one file at a time. I might prioritize closing docker_run.log since it's larger. However, I still need to monitor for artifacts. Maybe I should sleep for 15 minutes instead.**Choosing sleep option**\n\nI think the best choice here is to keep it simple and opt for minimal verbosity. So, I'll decide to sleep for 10 minutes. This way, I can allow the training process to continue without overcomplicating things. It gives me time to monitor the system later without needing immediate actions right now.

Best practices recommend getting an expert review after creating a plan, so I should do that at major\n💭 workflow checkpoints. I think the next step is to request expert advice on our plan and medal strategies. Plus, checking the environment is essential. Starting with `nvidia-smi` is suggested, so I’ll\n💭 execute that after creating the code cell.\n💭 **Requesting expert input** I think it’s a good idea to request expert guidance on known good features for CHAMPS, such as distance, angles, bond types, atom environments, and graph path lengths. For\n💭 our models, I want to ensure validation involves grouping by molecule name, possibly stratified by type using additional data files. I'm cautious about target leaks, especially using test contributions\n💭 . I can train models per type, leveraging features like structures, tensors, and potential energy. Let’s ask for more expert insight on this!\n💭 **Requesting expert review** I'm planning to use the `request_expert_review` function with the filepath `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb`. I want to include specific questions about confirming cross-validation\n💭 , feature sets, and modeling choices like XGB or CatBoost for each type. I also need guidance on how to handle large structure files (*.xyz) since I have a `structures.csv` that includes positions. So\n💭 , yes, let's go ahead and request that expert review!\nINFO: Agent JSON response received: {\n  \"tool\": \"request_expert_review\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Checkpoint A: Plan + strategy validation before coding.

I need to decide whether to keep checking the logs or view the content of the\n💭 docker_run.log. It’s already open, but the platform doesn’t show it automatically.\n💭 **Assessing execution status** I executed train_catboost_v1.py through the execute_code tool, which runs asynchronously. Right now, it’s still executing, and performance is low due to too many open files\n💭 , so I need to close some. The open files include 00_eda_and_planning.ipynb, train_xgb_v1.py, train_catboost_v1.py, and docker_run.log. I could close train_xgb_v1.py, but I might need the notebook.

The current script is train_catboost_v1.py, but it hasn't generated any artifacts yet—only updates in the docker log and an NVML error\n💭 with nvidia-smi. It seems the script is running fine, and I should check back later. However, performance health is low, suggesting I should close some open files, like train_xgb_v1.py and docker_run\n💭 .log, to enhance performance. Following instructions, I'll monitor periodically instead of forcing actions.\n💭 **Deciding on next steps** I think the next best action is to run monitoring cell 8 again or check for files in the file system. I could also open the out-of-fold file, but it might not exist. Running\n💭 monitoring cell 8 will take minimal time, or I could sleep for 10 minutes to let the training proceed. Since we have a performance alert, closing unnecessary files like train_xgb_v1.py or docker_run.log\n💭 could help, but I can only close one file at a time. I might prioritize closing docker_run.log since it's larger. However, I still need to monitor for artifacts. Maybe I should sleep for 15 minutes instead\n💭 .\n💭 **Choosing sleep option** I think the best choice here is to keep it simple and opt for minimal verbosity. So, I'll decide to sleep for 10 minutes. This way, I can allow the training process to continue\n💭 without overcomplicating things. It gives me time to monitor the system later without needing immediate actions right now. Okay, 10 minutes of sleep it is! Let's see how that helps the overall performance\n💭 .\nINFO: Agent JSON response received: {\n  \"tool\": \"sleep\",\n  \"sleep_payload\": {\n    \"sleep_duration_minutes\": 10.0\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"CatBoost training is running; no artifacts yet.
