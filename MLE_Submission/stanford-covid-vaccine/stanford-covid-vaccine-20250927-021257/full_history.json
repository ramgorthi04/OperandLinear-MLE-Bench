    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s a focused, medal-oriented synthesis drawing from all four audits, tailored to your current plan.\n\n1) Medal-winning strategies (historical → what to do now)\n- Must-have signals:\n  - BPP features are the biggest lift. Use ViennaRNA/RNAplfold (or Arnie/EternaFold if you have them) to compute BPP for train/test. Even if you don’t feed the full N×N matrix, derive strong per-position features from it (sum over j, max over j, pairedness prob, distance to argmax pair, local aggregates).\n  - Core inputs: one-hot sequence (A/C/G/U), structure (.,(,)), predicted_loop_type (7 classes), positional features (index, length, sinusoidal PE), optional local GC and short k-mer context.\n- Architectures that worked:\n  - Fast, strong: 2–3 layer BiGRU/BiLSTM (hidden 128–512), optionally with a small Conv1D front-end and a light attention layer; multi-head output (one per target).\n  - GNNs over pairing graphs were top-tier but slower to implement—skip unless you have time after a strong RNN baseline.\n  - Transformers worked with heavy tuning; not the fastest path in <24h.\n- Ensembling:\n  - Simple but effective: k-fold models × 2–3 seeds; include diversity via GRU vs LSTM and with/without BPP. Average or OOF-weighted blend. Heavier ensembling (10–20 models) was common among golds, but you can get a medal with fewer if features/CV are solid.\n\n2) CV protocol that mirrors test\n- Use sequence-level folds only. GroupKFold(n_splits=5) grouped by sequence id. Stratify by length bucket (107 vs 130) and SN_filter if present to balance folds.\n- Masking:\n  - Pad to max length in batch.\n  - Compute loss only on valid positions. If seq_scored exists (e.g., 68 or 91), mask loss/metrics to the first seq_scored positions.\n- Length distribution:\n  - The original private set consisted of 130-length sequences with different scored positions vs public. Ensure each fold’s val includes both lengths and evaluate with the same masking you’ll use at test time.\n- Leakage to avoid:\n  - No position-level splitting. Fit any scalers/encoders on train fold only. If computing BPP, use sequence/structure only (no targets).\n\n3) Metric/targets for this benchmark\n- Do not assume. Immediately inspect:\n  - sample_submission columns. If they are per-target probabilities across classes (e.g., reactivity_0…reactivity_K-1), it’s multiclass log loss → softmax per head + cross-entropy with masking.\n  - train.json targets. If continuous floats as in the original, it’s likely regression and the doc is wrong → multi-head regression, evaluate CV with MCRMSE (mean of RMSE across the 5 targets); optimize MSE/Huber with masking.\n- Rule of thumb:\n  - If submission expects probabilities, use classification and CE.\n  - If it expects five float columns (one per target), use regression and compute MCRMSE for CV.\n\n4) Fastest path to a strong baseline (<24h)\n- You can get a working Bronze-ish baseline quickly without BPP to validate pipeline and submission; but BPP is typically required to move into silver/gold territory.\n- Baseline recipe (fast):\n  - Inputs: one-hot sequence/structure/loop + positional features; optional local GC.\n  - Model: small Conv1D front-end → 2× BiGRU or BiLSTM → per-target heads (logits for CE, linear for regression). AMP on, grad clip, early stopping on masked val metric. Batch 32–64, lr ~1e-3 AdamW.\n  - Train 3–5 folds, 1–2 seeds. Average fold predictions for a first submission.\n- Upgrade for medal push:\n  - Add ViennaRNA BPP. Start with engineered per-position BPP features (sum/max/pairedness/distance) for a quick, reliable lift. If time remains, add low-rank projections or local BPP windows as extra channels.\n  - Add a second architecture (GRU vs LSTM or different kernel sizes) for ensemble diversity.\n\n5) Common pitfalls to avoid\n- Submission formatting:\n  - id_seqpos must exactly match sample (e.g., id_XXXX_0). Easiest is to merge your long-format predictions into sample_submission to preserve order and columns. If classification, ensure per-head probabilities sum to 1.\n- Scoring mask:\n  - Always mask loss/metrics to valid positions (and to seq_scored if present). Don’t train or evaluate on padded tokens.\n- CV leakage:\n  - No token-level splits; no using fold-global normalization. Persist fold indices and reuse consistently.\n- Length/coverage mismatch:\n  - Don’t overfit to 107-length sequences; validate on a mix and replicate test masking behavior.\n- SN_filter handling:\n  - If SN_filter exists, many teams trained on all data but validated carefully. Ensure distribution is similar across folds; optionally stratify by SN_filter.\n- Feature leakage:\n  - Structure/loop are allowed. Don’t derive any feature from targets. If computing BPP, fix parameters and apply identically to train/test.\n\n6) Ensemble under time constraints\n- Train 5-fold × 1–2 seeds of your main RNN. Add one variant (GRU vs LSTM or +BPP vs -BPP).\n- Blend by simple average first. If you have OOF for each model, fit non-negative weights minimizing OOF metric (global or per head). Keep it simple to finish inference comfortably.\n\nConcrete next steps (tight timeline)\n- T0–1h: Verify GPU/torch-cu121. Inspect train.json + sample_submission to decide regression vs classification; confirm presence/absence of seq_scored, SN_filter, 107/130 mix, and any provided bpps.\n- T1–3h: Implement GroupKFold by id, stratify by length (and SN_filter if present). Save splits.\n- T2–6h: Build/train a small CNN+BiGRU/LSTM with proper masking and the correct loss (CE or MSE/Huber). Produce OOF + test preds. Create and submit a sanity submission (merge onto sample_submission to check shape).\n- T6–12h: Compute ViennaRNA BPP (RNAplfold) for all sequences; derive per-position features (sum/max/pairedness/distance). Retrain the same model with BPP features. Submit.\n- T12–20h: Add a variant (GRU↔LSTM or different kernel/hidden). Train 5-fold or 3-fold if tight. Blend models (equal weights or OOF-weighted). Submit improved ensemble.\n- T20–24h: Error analysis on OOF by length/structure; small tweaks (label smoothing if CE, small dropout/weight decay adjustments), final ensemble and checks.\n\nKey takeaways\n- Confirm metric/targets first; choose CE vs MSE accordingly.\n- Sequence-level CV with strict masking is non-negotiable.\n- BPP provides the biggest improvement; add it as soon as you have a validated baseline.\n- Keep ensembling simple and diversity intentional (seeds + 1–2 architecture/feature variants).\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Pivot now to a structure-aware sequence-labeling pipeline with correct metric/masking, sequence-level CV, bpps-driven features/graphs, and an ensembled, calibrated predictor. Explicitly solve the 68+ position generalization.\n\nDiagnosis\n- Current 0.638 log-loss is far from bronze (≤0.353). Likely issues: metric mismatch (regression vs log-loss), loss computed on unscored/padded tokens, weak structure usage, poor 68+ handling, and/or submission shape/calibration errors.\n\nPriority fixes (next 24h)\n- Metric/labels: Confirm targets are class-binned; train with cross-entropy (not MSE). If not pre-binned, discretize exactly as provided artifacts do. Use label smoothing ~0.02.\n- Masking: Compute loss only on scored positions; mask padding.\n- Submission hygiene: Predict all required positions (handle 107 and 130); probabilities sum to 1; id_seqpos mapping/order matches sample_submission; correct number of rows.\n- CV: Sequence-level splits (do not split by positions). Use 5-fold KFold/GroupKFold over sequences, length-aware (bucket 107 vs 130). Align CV metric to the scored window.\n- Data quality: Use SN_filter or SNR as weights/filter. Validate on clean subsets.\n- Efficiency: Mixed precision, gradient clipping, length bucketing.\n\nModel + features (fast, strong baseline)\n- Architecture: 2–4 layer BiGRU/LSTM (hidden 128–256) or small CNN+BiGRU; multi-task heads (one per target).\n- Inputs:\n  - Tokens: base one-hot (A,C,G,U), dot-bracket one-hot, loop type one-hot.\n  - Pairing (critical): from bpps per position: row/col sum, max, entropy, top-k sums, distance to argmax pair; thresholds counts.\n  - Structure-lite: is_paired, partner index/distance, pair type (AU/CG/GU) from dot-bracket.\n  - Positional/context: i, i/L, distance to ends, local GC%, 2–3-mer counts, loop/stem run-lengths.\n- Training: AdamW lr≈1e-3, wd 1e-4–1e-3, cosine/OneCycle, dropout 0.3, grad clip 1.0, early stopping on CV log-loss (scored window). TTA: sequence reversal (flip bpps/structure) and average.\n\n68+ strategy (medal-critical)\n- Shifted-window training: Randomly shift input windows; predict scored window to teach extrapolation beyond 68.\n- Simulate private: Hold out “long/complex” sequences or 68+ segments for validation.\n- Pseudo-labeling: Train on 0–67, infer 68+, add high-confidence pseudo-labels for retraining.\n- Physics bias: Leverage structure heavily (unpaired regions degrade faster); include pairing features prominently.\n\nAdvanced boost (optional but high impact)\n- Graph/hybrid: Build RNA graph (nodes=bases; edges=backbone + bpps>τ). 2–4 layer GCN/GAT/MPNN; fuse graph embeddings with BiGRU via attention/concat. Or graph transformer. Light post-smoothing along graph neighbors.\n- Regularization/aug: Noise/jitter bpps, dropout on structure channels.\n\nEnsembling + calibration\n- Train 5 folds × 2–3 seeds for BiGRU; add a small Transformer or CNN+RNN for diversity. Average logits/probs; weight via OOF optimization.\n- Calibrate on OOF (temperature scaling or isotonic) to reduce overconfidence and log-loss.\n- TTA (reversal) across all models.\n\nValidation alignment\n- Sequence-level CV; same scored positions as submission; length-aware folds; report OOF log-loss matching LB computation. Track performance on 0–67 and simulated 68+.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Splitting by positions (leakage), computing loss on unscored/padded tokens, using regression loss for a classification metric, ignoring bpps/structure, not predicting 68+, misaligned bpps after reversal, wrong submission order/shape, no calibration, over-large unregularized models.\n\nMilestones and targets\n- Baseline BiGRU + correct masking/CV + basic features: ≤0.50 OOF.\n- Add bpps features + length-aware CV + reversal TTA: 0.40–0.45.\n- Add ensemble + calibration (+ optional graph/hybrid or pseudo-labeling): <0.35.\n\nAction checklist\n- Verify labels/metric, masking, submission format.\n- Implement sequence-level, length-aware CV with SN weighting.\n- Train BiGRU baseline with full feature set and reversal TTA.\n- Add bpps features; re-train; simulate 68+ and apply shifted-window training.\n- Ensemble across folds/seeds/architectures; calibrate on OOF.\n- Optional: add graph head and neighbor smoothing.\n- Iterate using OOF diagnostics by position/length/structure until <0.353."

    "llm_json": "**Considering baseline models**\n\nI realize that installing PyTorch will take time, so I’m thinking about starting with lightweight models using numpy. I could create a simple baseline, like a median profile per position or target, using averaged training targets for the first 68 positions. For positions 68 and up in the test set, maybe I can copy the last observed or the mean of known positions. It's important for the baseline to be reasonable, and I should also set up cross-validation folds. I’m wondering about predicting per-position means over training for those first 68 positions.**Establishing a baseline function**\n\nI see that the sample submission contains 25,680 rows, calculated from 240 sequences times 107 positions, while the training data only has labels for the first 68 positions. For positions 68 and above, I could use a heuristic, like filling them with the overall mean of the first 68 positions. I’ll create a baseline function that computes the mean for each target and position at the same index, and for those higher positions, just use the overall target mean. After that, I can produce a submission file in the correct format, which gives me a starting score to work with. I’ll also add a new code cell to handle this!\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"insert_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 2,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Fast baseline: per-position means for 0..67; global means for 68..106; write submission.csv\",\n      \"import pandas as pd, numpy as np\",\n      \"from pathlib import Path\",\n      \"\",\n      \"ss = pd.read_csv('sample_submission.csv')\",\n      \"try:\",\n      \"    tr = pd.read_json('train.json')\",\n      \"except ValueError:\",\n      \"    tr = pd.read_json('train.json', lines=True)\",\n      \"try:\",\n      \"    te = pd.read_json('test.json')\",\n      \"except ValueError:\",\n      \"    te = pd.read_json('test.json', lines=True)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"targets = ['reactivity','deg_Mg_pH10','deg_pH10','deg_Mg_50C','deg_50C']\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Stack train targets into long dataframe with seqpos only for scored positions\",\n      \"rows = []\",\n      \"for _, r in tr.iterrows():\",\n      \"    scored = int(r['seq_scored'])\",\n      \"    for t in targets:\",\n      \"        vals = np.array(r[t], dtype=float)\",\n      \"        for i in range(scored):\",\n      \"            rows.append((t, i, vals[i]))\",\n      \"train_long = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=['target','seqpos','value'])\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Compute per-position mean for 0..67 and global mean\",\n      \"pos_means = (train_long.groupby(['target','seqpos'])['value'].mean().unstack('seqpos'))\",\n      \"global_means = train_long.groupby('target')['value'].mean()\",\n      \"max_pos = pos_means.columns.max() if pos_means.shape[1] > 0 else 67\",\n      \"print('Computed pos_means up to position:', int(max_pos))\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Build prediction dict: for each test id and position 0..106\",\n      \"pred_map = {}  # key: (id, pos) -> dict of target->pred\",\n      \"for _, r in te[['id','seq_length','seq_scored']].iterrows():\",\n      \"    rid = r['id']\",\n      \"    L = int(r['seq_length'])\",\n      \"    scored = int(r['seq_scored'])  # expected 68\",\n      \"    for i in range(L):\",\n      \"        for t in targets:\",\n      \"            if i in pos_means.columns:\",\n      \"                val = float(pos_means.loc[t, i])\",\n      \"            else:\",\n      \"                # unscored positions fallback\",\n      \"                val = float(global_means.loc[t])\",\n      \"            pred_map[(rid, i, t)] = val\",\n      \"\",\n      \"# Merge predictions into sample_submission to preserve order\",\n      \"def parse_id_seqpos(x):\",\n      \"    # 'id_xxx_pos'\",\n      \"    s, pos = x.rsplit('_', 1)\",\n      \"    return s, int(pos)\",\n      \"\",\n      \"ids = []\",\n      \"pos = []\",\n      \"for v in ss['id_seqpos'].values:\",\n      \"    i, p = parse_id_seqpos(v)\",\n      \"    ids.append(i)\",\n      \"    pos.append(p)\",\n      \"ss['_id'] = ids\",\n      \"ss['_pos'] = pos\",\n      \"\",\n      \"for t in targets:\",\n      \"    ss[t] = [pred_map[(i, p, t)] for i, p in zip(ss['_id'], ss['_pos'])]\",\n      \"\",\n      \"ss.drop(columns=['_id','_pos'], inplace=True)\",\n      \"ss.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)\",\n      \"print('Wrote submission.csv with shape:', ss.shape)\",\n      \"print(ss.head())\"\n    ],\n    \"cell_type\": \"code\"\n  },\n  \"explanation\": \"Implemented a quick, valid baseline to ensure pipeline and submission format: per-position mean predictions for positions 0..67 (scored in train), and global mean for 68..106.

Requests: 1) Please confirm we should optimize MCRMSE (original competition metric) for CV despite task text mentioning multi-class-log-loss. 2) CV protocol: with all seq_length=107 and seq_scored=68 in both train/test here, is 5-fold GroupKFold by id with masking to first 68 positions sufficient? Any recommended stratification by SN_filter? 3) BPP features: Is RNAplfold available/allowed here, and recommended params (e.g., -W 150 -L 120 -u 1) to compute per-position aggregates (row-sum, max, entropy, distance to argmax)? Any faster proxies if ViennaRNA isn\\u2019t available? 4) 68+ strategy: With train labels only on 0..67, best practices to generalize to 68..106 (shifted-window training, sequence reversal TTA, pseudo-labeling) in this simplified 107-length setup? 5) Architecture: For <24h, confirm that a CNN+2xBiGRU/LSTM (128\\u2013256 hidden), inputs=[one-hot seq, dot-bracket, loop-type, positional, BPP aggregates], masked MSE/Huber, AMP, grad clip, should reach <0.40 OOF MCRMSE with BPP; any hyperparam shortcuts? 6) Ensembling: Given time, target 5-fold \\u00d7 2 seeds main model + 1 variant (GRU vs LSTM or +/\\u2212BPP) and average logits; should we add simple temperature scaling on OOF for calibration? After your guidance, I will install torch cu121, set up folds and masking, and implement the RNN baseline, then add BPP features.\"\n}",
    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the shortest, medal-focused synthesis across all four audits, mapped to your six requests plus a quick action plan.\n\n1) Metric\n- Optimize masked MCRMSE (mean of per-target RMSE) on positions 0..67 only. Ignore multi-class-log-loss. Use masked Huber/MSE for training; track OOF MCRMSE.\n\n2) CV protocol\n- 5-fold sequence-level CV is correct. Use GroupKFold by id with a mask to 0..67 for loss/metrics.\n- Better: StratifiedGroupKFold on SN_filter (and optionally binned signal_to_noise) to balance data quality.\n- Optionally weight loss by SN_filter (e.g., 1.0 vs 0.5); not required if you stratify well.\n\n3) BPP features\n- RNAplfold (ViennaRNA) is allowed and strongly recommended. It’s the biggest lift.\n- Params that work for L=107:\n  - Primary: RNAplfold -W 150 -L 120 -u 1 (or -u 3) [fast, strong]\n  - Alternative (slightly broader context): -W 240 -L 160 -u 1 --noLP\n- Per-position aggregates to derive:\n  - row-sum Σj p(i,j), max_j p(i,j), entropy −Σ p log p\n  - expected distance Σj p(i,j)|i−j|\n  - local mass within k∈{3,7,15}\n  - unpaired prob pu[i] from .lunp; pairedness=1−pu[i]\n- If ViennaRNA unavailable: proxies from dot-bracket/loop (paired flag, partner distance, stem/loop length/type, local GC%, sliding-window stats). Weaker, but better than nothing.\n- Compute once for train/test, cache to disk.\n\n4) Positions 68..106 strategy\n- Train with loss masked to 0..67; infer on full 0..106.\n- Add simple TTA: predict forward + reversed (reverse seq/structure/loop/BPP), reverse-back preds, average.\n- Shifted-window or pseudo-labeling are optional; only consider after a strong baseline.\n\n5) Architecture and expected performance\n- Inputs: one-hot seq (4), dot-bracket (3), loop type (7), positional (index/length or sin/cos), + BPP aggregates (5–10 channels). Standardize continuous channels; keep one-hots raw.\n- Model: light CNN (1–2 Conv1d, kernel 3–7, 64–128 ch) → 2×BiGRU or BiLSTM (hidden 256, dropout 0.2–0.3) → linear head to 5 targets per position. LayerNorm after conv is fine.\n- Training: HuberLoss (δ≈0.5–1.0) or MSE; AdamW lr 5e-4–1e-3; wd 1e-4–5e-2; cosine or ReduceLROnPlateau; batch 32–64; epochs 20–60 with early stop; AMP on; grad clip=1.0.\n- Expectation: with BPP, <0.40 OOF MCRMSE is realistic in this setup. Without BPP, expect notably worse.\n\n6) Ensembling\n- 5-fold × 2 seeds for the main model (+BPP) + one diversity variant (GRU vs LSTM or −BPP). Simple mean first.\n- Optional: fit non-negative per-model weights on OOF to minimize MCRMSE; small extra gain.\n- Temperature scaling is for classification; skip for this regression task.\n\nImmediate action plan (24h)\n- Environment: install torch cu121; verify GPU.\n- Splits: build and save StratifiedGroupKFold by id with SN_filter; implement position mask.\n- Baseline: train CNN+BiGRU without BPP to validate pipeline; produce OOF and a submission.\n- BPP: install/check RNAplfold; compute features; integrate and retrain with same pipeline.\n- Inference: enable reverse TTA; generate submission.\n- If time: second seed + one variant; average predictions and submit.\n\nCritical gotchas\n- Always compute loss/metrics only on 0..67.\n- Keep sequence-level grouping; no token-level leakage.\n- Merge predictions into sample_submission order; preserve all 5 columns as floats.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: Move from per-position means to a sequence- and structure-aware, CV-aligned, ensembled model with strong features and masking. Target OOF ≤0.36 first; add BPPS to push ≤0.35.\n\nPriority plan (most impact first)\n- Validation and metric\n  - Use 5-fold GroupKFold by sequence id; never split positions within a sequence.\n  - Train/evaluate only on positions 0–67 (mask loss); still feed full length 107.\n  - Optimize regression loss (MSE/SmoothL1); track OOF MCRMSE. Ignore “log-loss” language.\n  - Fix seeds; report OOF per fold and per target.\n\n- Data quality and targets\n  - Either train on SN_filter==1 only or weight loss by signal_to_noise (cap/normalize).\n  - Consider target transforms for stability: log1p on degradation targets; sqrt/tanh on reactivity. Invert before submission.\n  - Standardize numeric features per fold.\n\n- Features that matter\n  - Core tokens: one-hot/embeddings for sequence (A/C/G/U), structure (.,(,)), predicted_loop_type (B,E,H,I,M,S,X).\n  - Pairing from dot-bracket: is_paired, paired_index, paired_distance/L, stem length, loop run-length.\n  - Positional/context: index i, i/L, distance-to-ends, start/end flags, rolling GC (win=3/5/11), k-mer counts (2–4).\n  - Big boost (add as soon as feasible): Base Pairing Probabilities (BPPS via ViennaRNA). Derive per-position row/col sum/max, entropy, expected paired distance, nonzero count, windowed pools.\n\n- Model (fast, strong baseline)\n  - CNN+BiGRU/BiLSTM trunk: 1–2 Conv1D blocks (64–128 filters, k=5–9) → 1–2 BiGRU/BiLSTM layers (hidden 256–512, dropout 0.2–0.4) → shared dense → 5 regression heads.\n  - Multi-task setup shares backbone; mask loss to 68 scored positions.\n  - If time-pressed, start with a BiLSTM-only baseline, then add CNN front end.\n\n- Training details\n  - AdamW, batch 32–64, 10–20 epochs, mixed precision, early stopping on val MCRMSE, gradient clipping (e.g., 1.0).\n  - Learning-rate schedule (cosine or ReduceLROnPlateau).\n  - Save OOF and test preds per fold/seed.\n\n- Ensembling and post-processing\n  - Train 3–5 seeds; optionally mix BiGRU and BiLSTM variants; average preds (OOF-based or uniform weights).\n  - Clip outputs to train quantile ranges per target (e.g., reactivity ~[0,2], deg_* ~[0,5]); improves stability.\n  - For unscored positions (68–106), use model outputs; if noisy, blend with per-position means.\n\n- Milestones and gates\n  - Baseline sequence model OOF <0.38.\n  - Add SN weighting/filtering + clipping/target transforms → OOF ≤0.36 (bronze range).\n  - Add BPPS features → typical +0.01–0.03; aim ≤0.35.\n  - If stalled >0.36 OOF after 2–3 iterations, try transformer encoder or simple RNA graph (GAT/GCN) and ensemble.\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid\n- Token-level CV or training on unscored positions as labeled.\n- Treating as classification/log-loss; not masking to 0–67.\n- Ignoring structure/loop type or pairing; using error columns as predictors (use only for weighting).\n- Submission mapping errors (id_seqpos order).\n\n48-hour action checklist\n- Implement 5-fold GroupKFold, masked MCRMSE metric, SN weighting.\n- Build CNN+BiGRU multi-head model with the core token, pairing, positional, and context features.\n- Train 3 seeds with early stopping; ensemble; clip outputs; verify submission format.\n- Compute ViennaRNA BPPS; integrate derived BPPS features; retrain and re-ensemble."

    "llm_json": "**Planning the next steps**\n\nI need to outline our next actions. We have the baseline submission CSV ready, and it's time to build the model. First, I'll focus on feature encodings and the dataset class. We might consider installing ViennaRNA, but since the experts suggested we start with a baseline without BPP, I’ll prioritize a code cell for the dataset, model, and training loop. I realize this could be a big task, so starting with the utilities and dataset seems most feasible before implementing training.**Developing preprocessing steps**\n\nI should start by preprocessing the train and test data into NumPy arrays for features and targets. I’ll implement encoder maps for bases (A, C, G, U) and structures (., (, )). The function will encode sequences, returning L x C features, where C could be based on several aspects like position normalized and absolute indices. I think using sinusoidal positional encoding sounds good to keep things simple. We’ll also integrate whether characters are paired, and we can pad targets as needed. Finally, I'll build a DataLoader for batches and set up a simple 2-layer BiLSTM model.**Preparing for data and model setup**\n\nI also need to aggregate the OOF data back into a long format to create the submission, along with planning to implement reverse TTA later. Given our time constraints, I’ll set up the cell to define the dataset, model, and training functions without executing them just yet. Next, I’m considering adding cell 5 to build encoders, tensorize the data per row, and create the PyTorch Dataset classes (TrainDataset, TestDataset) along with the SimpleBiLSTM model class, training loop, and K-fold logic.

I'll start by keeping the epochs small, like 5, to run initial tests. After that, I’ll log the process and build a submission that matches the sample. It makes sense to save the out-of-fold metrics too. So, I’ll insert cell index 6 for loading data, looping folds, and collecting predictions to build the final submission.**Aligning test predictions**\n\nI need to implement a mapping from ID to index order in the test dataset to align concatenated predictions. Since the `run_fold` function returns `test_pred` in the same order as the `te_df`, I can stack and average the results by matching the order with a `test_ids` list. It feels safer to create a map from ID to row index to keep order consistent across folds. I'll convert test predictions to the shape [Ntest, L, T] and build long-form rows for all `id_seqpos` in `sample_submission`.

    "llm_json": "**Fixing SyntaxError in code**\n\nI need to address a SyntaxError in cell 5. It seems like there's a problem with an f-string that's causing a \"backslash\" error due to a newline character. The list comprehension has this newline, which isn't allowed in f-strings. To fix this, I’ll create the `per_target` string outside the f-string or join it properly. I plan to edit cell 5 to compute `per_target_str` by joining the rounded values from `rmses`. After that, I'll execute cell 5 and then cell 6 to begin training, but I should reduce the EPOCHS from 12 to a smaller number for initial testing.**Modifying training settings**\n\nI need to set EPOCHS to 5 in cell 6 for the run, but first, I should address cell 5. I’ll avoid using the f-string expression with the comprehension and calculate `per_target_fmt` first instead. I also need to think about other potential issues, like whether having `num_workers=2` in the DataLoader is suitable. The lengths used in `pack_padded_sequence` are based on a mask that might be causing truncation. I want to ensure that the model can process the required token lengths up to 106, rather than just 68 due to padding.**Adjusting lengths for predictions**\n\nIn the `collate_train` function, I'm realizing that `x` includes all `L`, but when I set the lengths to 68 and pad back, the outputs will also be 68 long. This means predictions beyond 68 won't be included, and that’s manageable for evaluations since I’d only look at 0-67. However, for test predictions, I need all 107 outputs, but using `mb.sum` again will limit me to 68 time steps. I need to ensure that the lengths for LSTM packing represent the full sequence length, but I can still mask the loss based on 68. I think I'll also return true lengths in the `collate` function or calculate them directly from the input for each batch.**Computing lengths for batches**\n\nI realize we can simplify things by calculating lengths from the content of each batch instead of using `mb.sum`. So, I'll adjust the method for training, validation, and test to use the formula `lens = (xb.abs().sum(dim=2) > 0).sum(dim=1).long()`. This will process full sequences and allow outputs up to the maximum length of 107, which is great! I also need to mask for test predictions to ensure we maintain that full length. I'll update the relevant lines in `run_fold` to remove the dependency on `mb` for lengths and consider reducing epochs in cell 6, but I’ll handle that afterward.

Any others that consistently helped? 3) Integration pattern: add these as extra continuous channels to the existing one-hot+pos features, standardized per fold. Any normalization/clip ranges you recommend for stability? 4) Training tweaks for fast gains: Huber vs MSE (delta suggestion), SN_filter weighting (e.g., weight=1.0 if SN_filter==1 else 0.5) vs filtering out SN_filter==0; target transforms (log1p for deg_* and maybe sqrt for reactivity) and invert at inference; per-target output clipping to train quantiles. Which of these typically gives the best immediate improvement? 5) Reverse TTA: confirm the minimal correct implementation steps (reverse seq/structure/loop and bpp features, run inference, reverse outputs and average) to avoid misalignment. 6) Any quick architectural adjustment worth doing before BPP (e.g., add 1 Conv1D layer with k=5, ch=128 before BiLSTM) to improve without much code?

If you need max speed, -u 1 is OK.\n- Parallelization (either is fine):\n  - GNU parallel:\n    - Write one FASTA per id under seqs/{id}.fasta (>id\\nsequence).\n    - mkdir -p plfold_out\n    - find seqs -name '*.fasta' | parallel -j $(nproc) 'OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 RNAplfold -W 150 -L 120 -u 3 -noLP < {} && mv *_lunp plfold_out/{/.}_lunp && mv *_dp.ps plfold_out/{/.}_dp.ps'\n  - Python multiprocessing:\n    - For each id: printf \">id\\nSEQ\\n\" | OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 RNAplfold -W 150 -L 120 -u 3 -noLP\n    - Save outputs to plfold/{id}/{id}_lunp and {id}_dp.ps (or just plfold_out/{id}_*).\n- Parsing:\n  - _dp.ps: lines like “i j p_sqrt ubox”; probability is (p_sqrt)^2; 1-based indices; symmetrize matrix.\n  - _lunp: pu[u] columns; handle both formats [i pu1 pu2 …] or [pu1 pu2 …]; pu1 is unpaired prob for u=1, pu3 for u=3.\n\n2) Per-position aggregates with best ROI (add in this order)\n- pu1 (unpaired) and pairedness_alt = 1 - pu1\n- row_sum = Σ_j p(i,j)\n- row_max = max_j p(i,j)\n- entropy = -Σ_j q(i,j) log q(i,j), where q(i,j) = p(i,j) / (row_sum + eps)\n- expected_distance_norm = Σ_j p(i,j)|i-j| / (row_sum + eps) / (L-1)\n- local_mass_k for k in {7, 3, 15}: Σ_{|i-j|≤k} p(i,j)\n- Optional if time: pu3; left_mass/right_mass and dir_bias = (right-left)/(row_sum+eps).\n- Start with ~8–10 channels: [row_sum, row_max, entropy, exp_dist_norm, lm7, lm3, lm15, pu1, (optional pu3), 1-pu1].\n\n3) Integration and normalization\n- Concatenate these continuous channels to your current one-hot + positional features in encode_row.\n- Per-fold standardization:\n  - Fit mean/std on train fold only for all continuous channels (positional scalars + BPP aggs). Leave one-hots untouched.\n  - Apply to val/test of that fold; clip z-scores to [-5, 5]. Fill any NaNs (from 0/0) with 0 before scaling.\n- If any sequence missing BPP files, fill its BPP channels with zeros.\n\n4) Training tweaks (priority)\n- Loss: switch to Huber/SmoothL1; beta/delta = 1.0; reduction='none'; apply your existing 0..67 mask.\n- SN_filter weighting: keep all data; weight=1.0 if SN_filter==1 else 0.5; multiply per-sample loss (broadcast to [B,1,1]) before masked reduction.\n- Epochs: train 20–40 epochs with early stopping on val MCRMSE; AMP + grad clip 1.0 + ReduceLROnPlateau(patience=2, factor=0.5) if easy.\n- Target transforms (optional, after BPP if time): log1p on all deg_* targets; keep reactivity as-is; invert with expm1 at inference. Small extra gain. Per-target inference clipping to fold 0.5–99.5% quantiles yields minor stability.\n\n5) Reverse TTA (minimal, correct)\n- Build reversed inputs by reversing along sequence axis all per-position channels (one-hots, positional encodings that are index-based, and BPP aggregates). If you add directional features (left/right), swap them on reverse; for the recommended symmetric features just reverse.\n- preds_fwd = model(x)\n- preds_rev = model(x[:, ::-1, :]); preds_rev = preds_rev[:, ::-1, :]\n- final = 0.5*(preds_fwd + preds_rev)\n- Keep loss/metrics masked to positions <68. If using target transforms, average in transform space, then invert.\n\n6) Quick architecture tweak\n- Add a single Conv1D front-end before the BiLSTM:\n  - Conv1d(in_ch, 128, kernel_size=5, padding=2) + ReLU + Dropout(0.2–0.3)\n  - Feed its output (B,L,128) into your BiLSTM (hidden 256, 2 layers). This is a cheap, consistent gain.\n- Save GRU variant for a quick ensemble after the above is solid.\n\nPractical tips\n- Cache parsed BPP features per id as .npy to avoid re-parsing.\n- Ensure no fold leakage in scaling or clipping thresholds.\n- Always evaluate/optimize on positions 0–67 only.\n- Submission mapping: keep your existing id_seqpos merge.\n\nExecution order now\n1) Install ViennaRNA; compute RNAplfold with -W 150 -L 120 -u 3 -noLP; cache outputs; parse and cache per-id feature arrays.\n2) Integrate channels; per-fold z-score + clip; add Huber + SN weighting; increase epochs.\n3) Add reverse TTA at inference.\n4) Optional: add Conv1D; optional deg_* log1p; optional per-target clipping.\n5) Rerun 5-fold (20–40 epochs); if time, train GRU and average.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: pivot to a structure-aware regression pipeline optimized for MCRMSE, with SN-filtered data, BPP/partner features, a stronger CNN+BiLSTM (plus a light Transformer) ensemble, log1p+Huber loss, reverse-TTA, and 3–5 seed blending.\n\n- Metric and CV alignment\n  - Optimize masked MCRMSE (positions <68).

    "llm_json": "**Considering alternatives for BPP computation**\n\nI need to address the inability to install via apt-get due to a read-only filesystem. It looks like I need an alternative to compute BPP without ViennaRNA. I could derive features from the dot-bracket structure, using the provided structure and predicted loop types from the competition. By creating a pairing partner index, I can analyze pairedness and distance to enhance my model. I'm also thinking about switching to SmoothL1 loss and increasing the number of epochs while exploring potential enhancements like Conv1D.**Planning dataset modifications**\n\nNext, I need to modify the dataset to include engineered features and add per-fold standardization. I plan to adjust the loss to SmoothL1 with sample weights and introduce a Conv1D front end, along with reverse TTA during inference. Increasing epochs to 30 could take some time, especially with 5 folds. Each epoch is around 1 to 0.9 seconds, adding up to approximately 135 seconds for training. I’ll need to implement a new function to parse dot-bracket structures and standardize continuous features while ensuring one-hot features remain untouched.**Modifying encode_row function**\n\nCurrently, our encode_row function outputs a total of 19 channels, including various one-hot encodings and positional scalars. I plan to append engineered continuous features, like is_paired and partner_distance_norm, but only standardize the continuous channels, which include the last five positional features and the new ones. I’ll adjust the function to output a mask indicating the continuous columns, starting at a global index of 14. I also need to implement a scaler dictionary in run_fold to calculate mean and std for the scaling process. Finally, I’ll work on SmoothL1Loss, incorporating a mask with the SN_filter for weight adjustments.**Implementing per-sample loss and TTA**\n\nI need to implement a weight scalar in TrainDataset, focusing on per-sample losses when calculating the loss. The masked loss will return an average for each sample by computing the mask sums and squared errors, ensuring I use SmoothL1 with a reduction of 'none' to multiply losses by the mask, then average them by weights. \n\nFor the reverse TTA during inference, I must create a flipped version of the batch, average the results, and apply this to OOF validation. Finally, I'll add a Conv1D layer with 128 filters and a kernel of 5, and make adjustments to the necessary definitions in my implementation.**Adding feature engineering functions**\n\nI need to create new functions to engineer features like parsing the dot-bracket to get partner indices, stack depth, and run lengths. For each position, I'll calculate features such as is_paired, partner index or distance, stem depth, normalized stem and loop run lengths, and distance to ends. \n\nAdditionally, I'll compute GC content in a 5-base window, which requires examining surrounding bases. I plan to implement these within encode_row, recognizing that it loops through positions while keeping changes minimal for code size. Finally, I’ll modify cell 5 accordingly.\n{\n  \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"filepath\": \"00_eda_and_planning.ipynb\",\n  \"file_edit_payload\": {\n    \"notebook_edit_type\": \"modify_cell\",\n    \"notebook_cell_index\": 5,\n    \"source\": [\n      \"# Dataset, model, and training utilities with engineered structure features, standardization, SmoothL1 loss, Conv1D front-end\",\n      \"import math, random, gc, time, os\",\n      \"import numpy as np, pandas as pd\",\n      \"import torch\",\n      \"import torch.nn as nn\",\n      \"import torch.nn.functional as F\",\n      \"from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\",\n      \"\",\n      \"DEVICE = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\",\n      \"SEED = 42\",\n      \"torch.manual_seed(SEED);

Specific install commands that work under a read-only apt and internet-enabled pip-only environment. 2) If no true BPP possible, what pseudo-BPP features most help from provided dot-bracket/loop: e.g., construct a sparse P with 1.0 at annotated partner and small Gaussian mass along stem neighborhood; distance-k band smoothing; entropy proxies; left/right mass using run-lengths?

    "outcome": "EXPERT ADVICE: Here’s the shortest path to medal-range CV given your constraints and current 0.91 OOF.\n\n1) BPP without apt (pip-only)\n- Try the official wheel first:\n  - pip install --upgrade --only-binary=:all: \"viennarna>=2.6.4\"\n  - Sanity check:\n    - python - <<'PY'\n      import RNA, shutil; print('ViennaRNA', RNA.__version__); print('RNAplfold exe:', shutil.which('RNAplfold'))\n      PY\n  - If RNAplfold is found, reuse your existing plfold parsing code (drop apt lines).\n- Fast fallback that works via pip:\n  - pip install linearpartition\n  - Usage (per sequence):\n    - from linearpartition import linearpartition as lp\n      P = lp.compute_bpp(seq, beam_size=100)  # returns LxL float32 approx BPP\n- Optional fallback:\n  - pip install linearfold-unofficial\n    - from linearfold import linearfold\n      P = linearfold.partition(sequence, beam_size=100)\n- If all fail, proceed with pseudo-BPP (next point).\n\n2) Pseudo-BPP that actually lifts\n- Build a smoothed, symmetric “fake” P around the annotated partner and derive per-position aggregates. This is fast, pure-Python, and gives a big jump.\n\nConcrete recipe (per sequence, L=107):\n- Create partner[] from dot-bracket.\n- P construction (band smoothing):\n  - params: paired_p0=0.9, band=3, sigma=1.2, neighbor_p=0.1, unpaired_eps=0.02\n  - for i with partner j>=0:\n    - P[i,j]+=paired_p0\n    - for d=1..band: w=neighbor_p*exp(-(d*d)/(2*sigma*sigma)); add to P[i, j-d], P[i, j+d] in-bounds\n  - for i unpaired:\n    - for d=1..band: w=unpaired_eps*exp(-(d*d)/(2*sigma*sigma)); add to P[i, i-d], P[i, i+d]\n  - Symmetrize: P=max(P, P.T)\n- Derive 10 per-position channels (standardize per fold as you already do):\n  - row_sum = P.sum(1)\n  - row_max = P.max(1)\n  - entropy = −Σ q log q, q = P[i,:]/(row_sum[i]+1e-8)\n  - exp_dist_norm = Σ P[i,j]|i−j|/(row_sum[i]+1e-8)/(L−1)\n  - local_mass_k for k ∈ {3,7,15}\n  - left_mass = Σ P[i,j] for j<i; right_mass = Σ P[i,j] for j>i; dir_bias=(right−left)/(row_sum+1e-8)\n  - pu1_proxy = 1 − min(1.0, row_sum) and paired_proxy = 1 − pu1_proxy\n- Append these to your encode_row() continuous features. This alone typically halves your current OOF.\n\n3) Loss/target tweaks with highest ROI\n- Transform targets:\n  - Apply log1p to deg_* only during training; invert with expm1 for predictions/OOF calculation.\n- Weighting:\n  - Keep your SN weights (1.0 if SN_filter==1 else 0.5). If you have time, multiply loss by simple per-position weights w_pos = 1/(1+error_col) for each target; otherwise skip.\n- Clipping:\n  - After inverting deg_* at inference, clip per-target to train-fold [0.5%, 99.5%] quantiles.\n\n4) Architecture/training that moves the needle fast (no BPP required)\n- Model:\n  - Front-end: add a second dilated conv\n    - Conv1d(in,192,k=5,pad=2) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)\n    - Conv1d(192,192,k=5,pad=4,dilation=2) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)\n  - Swap LSTM→GRU, 2–3 layers, hidden=256–384, bidirectional, dropout=0.3.\n- Training:\n  - AdamW(lr=8e-4–1e-3, wd=1e-4–5e-2), grad clip 1.0, AMP on.\n  - Cosine schedule with warmup (or your ReduceLROnPlateau is fine).\n  - Reverse TTA at inference (you already do).\n- Quick diversity/ensemble:\n  - Train both BiGRU and BiLSTM variants (same features), average predictions.\n\n5) Public cached BPPs you can fetch\n- Kaggle datasets (join by id; files are {id}.npy with LxL BPP):\n  - xhlulu/openvaccine-bpp-matrices\n  - tito/openvaccine-bpps\n- Programmatic fetch (needs Kaggle API/token):\n  - pip install kagglehub; then:\n    - import kagglehub; path = kagglehub.dataset_download(\"xhlulu/openvaccine-bpp-matrices\")\n  - Load P = np.load(f\"{path}/bpps/{id}.npy\"), derive the same per-position aggregates listed above.\n- If Kaggle API is not available in your environment, fall back to linearpartition or the pseudo-BPP recipe.\n\nPractical action plan (do now)\n- Implement the pseudo-BPP aggregates in encode_row() and retrain 5-fold (expect a large drop from 0.91).\n- In parallel, try:\n  - pip install --only-binary=:all: \"viennarna>=2.6.4\" (use RNAplfold if found), else pip install linearpartition and compute P once; cache per-id features as .npy; load in Dataset.\n- Add deg_* log1p and inverse at inference; add prediction clipping.\n- Add the second dilated conv and switch to GRU; 30–40 epochs, cosine LR; keep reverse TTA.\n- If time permits, train both GRU and LSTM and average.\n\nThis combo (pseudo-BPP + deg_* log1p + dilated-conv+GRU + cosine + reverse TTA) typically reaches ~0.40–0.45 OOF; replacing pseudo-BPP with true BPP (ViennaRNA/LinearPartition or Kaggle BPPs) usually pushes into ~0.35–0.38, i.e., medal range.\n\n\n**Independent Kaggle Coach Feedback:** How to medal: prioritize the environment-aware plan (skip external BPP), train a stronger sequence model with proper CV and ensembling now; then layer in competition-proven upgrades.\n\nPriority actions (do now)\n- Drop external BPP attempts\n  - Comment out the ViennaRNA cell; it won’t install here. If your JSON ever includes a bpps field, use it; otherwise proceed without BPP.\n- Train a higher-capacity CNN+BiLSTM with your existing dot-bracket features\n  - Model: conv_ch≈192, hidden≈384, num_layers=3, dropout≈0.3; single shared trunk + small per-target heads (optional).\n  - Optim/training: AdamW (lr=1e-3, wd=1e-4), ReduceLROnPlateau, grad clip=1.0, AMP on, 20–30 epochs, batch_size=64, 5-fold GroupKFold by sequence id.\n  - Metric/loss alignment: compute loss only on positions 0–67; average equally across the 5 targets (SmoothL1/Huber works).\n  - Quality weighting: keep SN_filter weighting (downweight or drop SN_filter=0; 0.3–0.5 weight works well). Add per-position, per-target weights W ≈ 1/(1+error_t,pos) for scored positions.\n- Strengthen features from dot-bracket (no external BPP)\n  - Keep existing: one-hot seq/structure/loop; is_paired; partner distance; depth; run-lengths; GC window; position encodings.\n  - Add: pair-type one-hot at each position (AU, GC, GU, other, none) using partner + bases; “paired-side” flag (open vs close); signed/normalized partner distance.\n- Ensembling and TTA\n  - Train 2–3 seeds of the same architecture; average predictions. Use reverse-sequence TTA and average.\n  - Optionally add a small GRU variant to the ensemble.\n- Submission hygiene\n  - Predict for all positions 0..L-1; mask only affects training loss. Preserve id_seqpos order; clip outputs to [0,5].\n\nValidation and pitfalls to avoid\n- Use sequence-level folds (GroupKFold by id); fit scalers/statistics on train folds only.\n- Score OOF exactly as LB: MCRMSE over 5 targets, positions 0–67 only.\n- Don’t overfit to public LB; ensure consistent preprocessing; don’t ignore positions ≥68 in predictions.\n\nNext gains (add after the above is running)\n- Architectures: deeper CNN with residual/dilated blocks; small transformer block; or graph over pairing indices. Keep a diverse ensemble.\n- Training: 50–100 epochs, cosine LR, SWA, gradient accumulation; try direct MCRMSE or Huber variants; test-time dropout.\n- Data strategy: train separate models or heads for high/low SN; multi-task with shared trunk + per-target heads; learn ensemble weights; light post-processing (position-specific corrections).\n- If bpps becomes available: extract row_sum, row_max, entropy, expected distance, local mass windows; combine with current features.\n\nChecklist to run now\n1) Disable ViennaRNA cell. 2) Bump model capacity as above; add pair-type + paired-side features. 3) Add SN_filter and per-position error weights. 4) Train 5-fold, 2–3 seeds, with reverse TTA. 5) Average folds+seeds, clip to [0,5], write submission.\n\nExpected trajectory\n- Single strong CNN+BiLSTM + features + weighting + reverse TTA: ~0.355–0.365 MCRMSE.\n- + 2–3 seed ensemble (+ optional GRU): ~0.350–0.355, typically within bronze.\n\n---\n\n[2025-09-27 02:40:17] Cell 6 in `00_eda_and_planning.ipynb` has been executing for 5s and is still executing.
